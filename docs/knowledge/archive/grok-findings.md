# Code Review: Knowledge Base Service (Initial Codebase)

**Review target:** Full initial commit introducing the domain-agnostic RAG/knowledge base service (FastAPI + asyncio workers + Postgres + Qdrant/MinIO + LLM extraction). Sources in the repository root (`src/kb/`).

**Date of review:** 2026-05-26

---

## Summary

This is a substantial, ambitious initial codebase for a pluggable, schema-driven RAG service with strong separation of concerns, hybrid retrieval (dense+sparse+RRF+rerank+MMR+CRAG), entity resolution (deterministic keys + fuzzy + embedding tiebreak), parse-once/extract-many caching, per-stage tracing, cited synthesis + verification (AIS-style), DuckDB structured fallback, two working demo domains (SEC + legal), and comprehensive eval. The architecture described in `DESIGN.md` and `NOTES.md` is faithfully realized in the code.

**Overall assessment:** The system is largely correct in its high-level design and data flows. Most core invariants (domain-agnosticism, idempotency at file+schema level, provenance, "cited or it didn't happen") hold. However, **dominant risk areas** are:

- **Ingest reliability under concurrency** (cross-process races on Qdrant collection creation; partial mitigation that can still leave 404s).
- **LLM output parsing robustness** (multiple `json.loads` on untrusted model output with insufficient fallback protection in hot paths).
- **Error handling and partial-failure modes** in first-time ingestion, synthesis, and vector upserts.

Style and minor nits are secondary; correctness and edge-case gaps (especially around startup/ingest races and malformed LLM JSON) are the primary findings. 63/63 tests + lint clean per NOTES, but live concurrent ingest and adversarial LLM responses expose the issues. No "unwrap" (Python equivalent) explosions or egregious unnecessary clones were found; lock usage is the most interesting (and partially problematic) concurrency primitive.

No critical data-loss or injection bugs; the Postgres SKIP LOCKED job claiming, parameterized SQL, and SQL safety checks in DuckDB are solid.

## Issues

### Issue 1 -- Severity: bug
- File: src/kb/vector/qdrant_store.py:32
- Description: `ensure_collection` uses a per-process `asyncio.Lock` + in-memory `_ensured` set + 3-attempt retry with backoff. Because workers run in separate processes (see docker-compose, worker.py:58), the lock provides no cross-process exclusion. On concurrent first ingest for a domain, multiple workers can pass the existence check, hit create_collection races, sleep, and still reach the final `self._ensured.add(domain)` (line 65) without a successful collection. Subsequent `upsert` (called from indexer.py:130) and `hybrid_search` then perform scroll/upsert/query_points against a non-existent collection. The comment claims "caller can retry upsert" but no such retry wrapper exists in `index_extraction`, `upsert`, or the job runner. This is exactly the race described in NOTES.md:1152 (4/13 files failed on first concurrent run).
- Suggestion: Use a distributed lock (e.g., Postgres advisory lock via `pg_try_advisory_lock`), or perform a single idempotent collection bootstrap in the API lifespan (already attempted) + worker startup, or wrap the critical upsert/hybrid ops with a small retry + ensure loop that does not mark `_ensured` until creation visibly succeeds. At minimum, do not unconditionally add to `_ensured` on the failure path.
- Status: FIXED in commit `80ce401` (Postgres advisory lock for cross-process exclusion + ensure-and-retry op wrapper)

### Issue 2 -- Severity: bug
- File: src/kb/extract/llm.py:85
- Description: In the fallback path of `chat_json` (after the tool-call path or any exception on line 72), `return json.loads(resp.choices[0].message.content or "{}")` is executed with no surrounding try/except. If the model returns anything other than valid JSON (despite `response_format={"type":"json_object"}` — which many providers honor only loosely or not at all for DeepSeek), this raises `json.JSONDecodeError` that propagates to callers (`_extract_window`, `extract_intent`, `rewrite_query`, `hyde_passage`, `verify_citations`, etc.). The primary tool-call path has a try that falls back, but the fallback itself is unprotected. Similar pattern exists at line 71 inside the first try (but caught).
- Suggestion: Wrap the fallback `json.loads` in a `_coerce_json`-style helper (see the good example already present in `eval/ragas.py:74` and `eval/run.py:96`) that strips fences, searches for the first `{...}`, and returns `{}` (or raises a controlled error) on total failure. Make `chat_json` never raise on JSON shape; let callers decide.
- Status: FIXED in commit `0b99f83` (every chat_json path uses _coerce_json, never raises on JSON shape)

### Issue 3 -- Severity: bug
- File: src/kb/query/engine.py:371
- Description: Confidence JSON extraction after synthesis uses a regex that assumes the object is at the very end (`re.search(r"\{[^{}]*confidence[^{}]*\}\s*$"...)`), followed by an unconditional `json.loads(m.group(0))` inside a narrow try. LLM output frequently contains earlier `{...}` blocks or trailing text; the strip `answer_text = answer_text[: m.start()]` can leave the answer corrupted or the JSON parse can fail silently (falling back to default 0.5). The subsequent verify stage and refusal logic then operate on a potentially mangled answer. The prompt explicitly asks for the JSON "on its own line" but provides no enforcement.
- Suggestion: Reuse or import a robust `_coerce_json` helper (as in ragas.py). After stripping, validate that the remaining text still contains citations if required. Consider moving the confidence object to a separate structured field from the LLM (or a second call) rather than hoping it appears cleanly at EOF.
- Status: FIXED in commit `4b400c9` (confidence JSON now uses robust _coerce_json with explicit confidence-key check)

### Issue 4 -- Severity: bug
- File: src/kb/extract/runner.py:192
- Description: In the XLSX bridge path: `prov = rec.pop("_provenance")` (no default). While `extract_financial_metrics_from_xlsx` currently always emits the key (xlsx_bridge.py:119), the function contract of `extract_financial_metrics_from_xlsx` documents that it returns records with `_provenance`, but any future change, empty row handling, or direct call site would raise `KeyError`. Contrast with the safe `r.pop("_provenance", {})` on line 110 in the LLM path.
- Suggestion: Change to `prov = rec.pop("_provenance", {}) or {}` for defensive consistency and to avoid KeyError on any malformed bridge record.
- Status: FIXED in commit `4b400c9` (defensive default `{}` on the XLSX bridge pop)

### Issue 5 -- Severity: bug
- File: src/kb/storage/objects.py:130
- Description: `get_parse_artifact` does a bare `return json.loads(await _get_backend().get(object_key))`. The parse artifact is written by the same code path, but network/partial-write/object-store corruption, manual tampering of MinIO, or a future migration can produce invalid JSON. This crashes the entire extract stage (and thus the job) with no recovery.
- Suggestion: Wrap in a try that logs, treats as cache miss, and forces re-parse (or at least raises a typed `ParseArtifactCorrupt` error that the job runner already catches).
- Status: FIXED in commit `4b400c9` (ParseArtifactCorruptError typed, caller catches and falls through to re-parse)

### Issue 6 -- Severity: suggestion
- File: src/kb/vector/qdrant_store.py:179 (and callers in engine.py:224)
- Description: `hybrid_search` (and `upsert`) unconditionally call `await self.ensure_collection(domain)` then proceed with operations. After the race in ensure_collection (Issue 1), a collection may genuinely not exist yet `_ensured` contains the domain; the Qdrant client will raise 404 on the next operation with no local retry. The same pattern exists in `delete_by_file`.
- Suggestion: Add a small internal helper `async def _ensure_and_retry_op(...)` that catches collection-not-found (or generic 404/409 from Qdrant), calls ensure again (with force), and retries the op once. This makes the "caller can retry" comment actually true.
- Status: FIXED in commit `80ce401` (`_ensure_and_retry_op` wraps every vector op; on 404 force-ensure + retry once)

### Issue 7 -- Severity: suggestion
- File: src/kb/api/metrics.py:41 (and usage in record_query:49, render_prometheus:78)
- Description: A `threading.Lock` protects shared deques and counters. The FastAPI app is async; `record_query` is called from the query path (engine.py after `insert_query_trace`). While short critical sections on counters are usually safe, mixing threading primitives with asyncio creates the theoretical risk of blocking the event loop if the lock is ever held across an await (it isn't today) and complicates reasoning. Also, `p()` and `avg()` sort/scan the entire deque on every metrics scrape.
- Suggestion: Switch to `asyncio.Lock` (and make the recording functions async, or use a thread-safe queue + background aggregator). For the stats, consider approximate streaming quantiles (e.g., t-digest or simple reservoir) if scrape frequency becomes an issue.
- Status: FIXED in commit `f0b50c0` (drop threading.Lock — single event loop, no real concurrency; documented why)

### Issue 8 -- Severity: suggestion
- File: src/kb/query/engine.py:144 (and surrounding intent + duckdb logic)
- Description: The `looks_aggregate` keyword fallback (lines 145-151) is a heuristic list that tries to compensate for non-deterministic intent classification. It is duplicated in spirit in DuckDB and structured paths. Combined with the fact that `extract_intent` can fall back to "lookup" on any LLM error, aggregate/structured/DuckDB routes are sometimes silently suppressed even when the question clearly needs them.
- Suggestion: Make the keyword heuristic a small compiled regex or a single source of truth in `intent.py`. Consider adding a cheap local classifier or at least logging when the fallback fires vs. the LLM intent. This is a known limitation called out in NOTES.md:1190 and LIVE_VERIFICATION.
- Status: FIXED in commit `f0b50c0` (looks_aggregate hoisted to kb.query.intent; engine logs at INFO when fallback overrides classifier)

### Issue 9 -- Severity: nit
- File: src/kb/vector/embed.py:60
- Description: The bounded cache eviction `_query_cache.pop(next(iter(_query_cache)))` is O(1) for modern dicts but relies on insertion-order iteration. More importantly, the lock is acquired even on hit (double-checked locking pattern is present but the initial check at 54 is outside the lock, which is correct). No functional bug.
- Suggestion: Document the FIFO eviction policy and consider `collections.OrderedDict` or `functools.lru_cache` with a wrapper if the manual implementation ever grows more logic.
- Status: ACKNOWLEDGED (no functional bug; FIFO eviction documented in code comment via Grok #7 commit)

### Issue 10 -- Severity: nit
- File: src/kb/api/health.py:42
- Description: The object-store probe in `_probe_object` writes a probe object under `_healthz/probe.txt` on every readiness check and never deletes it. Harmless for MinIO/local but pollutes the bucket over time (especially under frequent k8s probes).
- Suggestion: Either delete after the exists check, use a distinct temp key per probe, or switch to a pure HEAD/metadata call if the backend supports it without write.
- Status: FIXED in commit `f0b50c0` (probe deletes via backend.delete after exists check, best-effort, cleanup failure does not fail probe)

### Issue 11 -- Severity: suggestion
- File: src/kb/jobs/worker.py:55
- Description: Signal handling uses `loop.add_signal_handler` inside a `contextlib.suppress(NotImplementedError)`. On Windows this is a no-op; workers will not shut down cleanly on Ctrl-C. The global `_running` flag is still polled, but the handler registration is best-effort only.
- Suggestion: For a containerized service this is minor, but add an explicit Windows fallback (e.g., `signal.signal` in a thread) or document that graceful shutdown is Unix-only.
- Status: FIXED in commit `f0b50c0` (explicit Windows fallback via signal.signal in the NotImplementedError branch)

### Issue 12 -- Severity: suggestion
- File: src/kb/extract/llm.py:72 and many call sites
- Description: Extremely broad `except Exception` around every LLM call (chat_json, chat_text_with_usage, etc.). This is intentional resilience, but it turns model auth failures (402), rate limits, context-length errors, and schema violations into silent fallbacks that produce empty extractions or default "lookup" intents. The job still succeeds (with zero entities) and the query still returns low-quality answers.
- Suggestion: At minimum, log at WARNING level with the exception type + first 200 chars of message for every swallowed LLM error in production paths. Consider distinguishing transient (retryable) vs. permanent (auth, quota) errors.
- Status: FIXED in commit `0b99f83` (auth/quota at ERROR level; retryable at WARNING; auth+quota re-raise so callers can fail loudly)

### Issue 13 -- Severity: nit
- File: src/kb/vector/indexer.py:110 (Contextual Retrieval)
- Description: When `synthesize.contextual_retrieval` is enabled, the parent document text is truncated to 12k chars (`[:12000]`) before sending to the extract-model LLM. No warning if truncation occurs on long filings. Combined with the known DeepSeek "thinking model" `max_tokens` gotcha called out in NOTES (80→400), this path is fragile.
- Suggestion: Log the actual token/character count sent for CR and surface truncation in the ingest trace/job metadata.
- Status: FIXED in commit `f0b50c0` (CR truncation now logs original length, trimmed length, and percent dropped at WARNING)

---

**Additional observations (no new numbered issues):**

- The layered config system (`defaults.yaml` < `domains/*/config.yaml` < env) is cleanly implemented in `kb/config/pipeline.py` and used consistently.
- Postgres SKIP LOCKED job claiming (`repo.py:495`) and the recursive CTE lineage queries are excellent.
- Dedup logic (content_hash with parent:/child: prefix) correctly fixed the self-dedup XLSX bug mentioned in NOTES.
- No hardcoded domain strings in core `src/kb/` (boundary tests in DESIGN.md pass).
- Test coverage is broad (vector contract, resolver logic, windowing, verify, dedup, etc.); the eval harness itself is part of the deliverable.

---

**Verdict:** The codebase demonstrates impressive engineering for a short-timeline project and successfully proves the domain-agnostic claim with real numbers on two unrelated schemas. The main blockers to production readiness are the cross-process collection creation race (Issue 1) and the brittle LLM JSON paths (Issues 2+3). Once those are hardened, the system is on a very strong footing. All issues above are flagged for developer action; none were fixed in this review.
