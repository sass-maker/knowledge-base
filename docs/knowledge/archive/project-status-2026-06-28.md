## Why/What

**Thesis:** Private Agent Search — Exa-style cited search over project-scoped private corpora. Users create domains, infer/confirm schemas, ingest files, and expose `/search` and `/query` APIs for agents. Wedge: specialized private corpus + explicit schemas + cited evidence, not generic chat RAG.

**In scope:** Final Cloudflare product owned by this repo, fleet **RAG_SERVICE** Cloudflare Worker (`cloudflare/worker`), TypeScript/Rust/WASM product runtime, demo domains (SEC + Legal), eval pipeline, consumer bindings (SaaS Maker, Linkchat, Starboard).

**Out / parked:** Public multi-user hosting without auth/limits, connector marketplace, High Signal integration (phase-2), semantic p99 <300 ms on cold Workers AI misses without cache.

**Migration complete live (2026-06-22):** `knowledgebase` is the only fleet RAG service and the current Cloudflare Worker is deployed at `https://knowledgebase.sarthakagrawal927.workers.dev` with fingerprint `knowledgebase-cloudflare-embedding-models-2026-06-21`. The deployed `free-ai` gateway now returns 6 enabled embedding models, all advertised dimensions (384/768/1024/1536) have matching Vectorize bindings and `tenant`/`index_id` metadata indexes, D1 migrations `0005_index_embedding_model.sql` and `0006_kb_domain_embedding_model.sql` are applied, and `RAG_SERVICE_KEYS_APPEND` contains the cutover key used by deployed Karte/Linkchat and Starboard. Live gates passed on 2026-06-22: `release-status:embedding-model -- --check-vectorize-metadata-indexes --check-knowledgebase-embedding-models` reports `ok: true`; `readiness:embedding-model` reports `ok: true`; `smoke:rag-crud:embedding-model` reports `ok: true` for create/ingest/query/delete plus `/v1/kb/ingest/text` custom input and `/v1/kb/search`; `readiness:full-port` with `RAG_ALLOW_LIVE_OCR=1` reports `ok: true`, hosted `/` and `/ui` checks green, and NVDA scanned-PDF OCR `pass_rate: 1`. The sibling `rag-service` repo remains deleted (source-only archive at `../rag-service-retired-2026-06-21.tgz`), and `audit:consumer-rag-integrations -- --require-complete` is green after deploying Karte and Starboard.

**Performance cache release live (2026-06-23):** D1 migration `0007_embedding_cache.sql` is applied, the deployed Worker version `e10f7319-1f17-4fa1-a23c-1bfb16b93141` has `RAG_SHARED_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED=true` and `RAG_SHARED_EMBEDDING_CACHE_ENABLED=true`, and `semantic` queries use a strong lexical precheck before embedding/Vectorize. Live fresh-domain proof at `/tmp/kb-s-proof-20260623-final` grades semantic `kb-query` performance S (`p95_ms=728.24`, `server_p95_ms=608`, hit rate `1.0`) and keeps retrieval quality/ingestion/deploy/evidence-scope at S. Follow-up work adds persisted trace timing stages, empty-result diagnostics, a typed `KnowledgebaseClient`, and `audit:client-contract`; after deploy, rerun `proof:s` to refresh observability/ease grades. Remaining non-code S cap is missing authenticated consumer cookies (reliability A+).

**Deployed corpus remains opt-in.** The cutover ships code + infra parity plus
consumer-ready indexes, not a full demo-corpus backfill. Live smokes create,
query, and clean up temporary RAG data; Starboard has a dedicated deployed index
for app sync; demo `legal`/`sec` query corpora still need an explicit ingestion
run before those domains answer production questions. To make demo queries
answer, run domain ingestion (e.g. `migrate-raw-files.mjs --queue-ingest` or the
`/v1/kb/files/:id/reprocess` route) from the R2 raw files -- this spends
Workers AI embedding calls and is an opt-in post-cutover step.

## Dependencies

### External

- **Cloudflare bindings (Worker):** free-ai/Workers AI embeddings, Vectorize (`rag-gemini-1536`, `rag-embedding-1024`, `rag-embedding-768`, `rag-embedding-384`), D1 `rag-db`, R2 `rag-raw-docs`.
- **Embedding selection:** index creation can choose enabled `free-ai`
  embedding models when a same-dimension Vectorize binding is configured.
  With `RAG_EMBED_PROVIDER=free_ai`, both explicit `embedding_model` selection
  and default profile creation fail closed unless the model is present and
  enabled in the live `free-ai` catalog. `/v1/kb/domains` and first-touch custom
  input routes can persist a selected free-ai embedding model/provider for the
  hosted custom input workflow; later auto-created `/v1/kb/*` domain indexes use
  the same validation and persist the canonical model/provider. KB file
  registration/upload, infer-upload, source import with auto-ingest,
  schema/file reprocess, source-set requeue, async text, inline record/text, and
  queued KB ingest check this before staging raw input, mutating ingest jobs, or
  enqueueing Queue/Workflow runs. Existing stored KB index models are also
  revalidated against the live free-ai catalog before scheduling new work.
  `preflight` fails if `RAG_EMBED_PROVIDER=free_ai` is missing the `FREE_AI`
  service binding, a complete default model/provider/dimension config, or a
  default embedding dimension that does not match the fixed-dimension
  `VECTORIZE` index name. The checked-in and deployed Worker config now binds
  every enabled dimension advertised by `free-ai` (384/768/1024/1536), so all
  current catalog embedding rows are selectable. `release-status:embedding-model`
  reports selected-model Vectorize readiness separately from deployed free-ai
  dimension readiness; live dimension readiness includes every enabled embedding
  dimension advertised by the deployed `free-ai` catalog. With
  `--check-knowledgebase-embedding-models` plus
  `RAG_SERVICE_KEY` it proves the deployed `/v1/embedding-models` endpoint is
  backed by live free-ai rows with selectable provider/dimension/binding details
  before live CRUD smoke. `audit:vectorize-embedding-bindings -- --require-all`
  now reports all required dimensions configured and no blockers.
  `audit:vectorize-metadata-indexes` is the read-only remote audit proving
  `tenant` and `index_id` metadata indexes exist on every configured Vectorize
  index, and
  `release-status:embedding-model -- --check-vectorize-metadata-indexes` folds
  that proof into the main read-only live status.
- **Secrets:** `RAG_SERVICE_KEYS` JSON map (never commit). Fleet audit: `pnpm fleet:secret-audit -- --project knowledgebase` from saas-maker.
  `RAG_SERVICE_PROOF_KEYS` is a separate optional JSON key map for short-lived
  live proof/eval keys so verification does not replace consumer cutover keys.
- **AI Gateway cache:** implemented but not enabled (Wrangler OAuth blocked gateway creation).

### Internal fleet

- **SaaS Maker:** no active in-API RAG/knowledge backend; old knowledge routes, tables, and service bindings were removed on 2026-06-20.
- **Linkchat:** wired via service binding; legacy SaaS Maker RAG fallback removed for profile-memory create/ingest/delete/search.
- **Starboard:** wired via service binding; relevance search now uses
  `knowledgebase` RAG or lexical-only results, `/api/stars/sync` ingests repo
  documents through the same shared RAG client, and Starboard's Turso vector table
  remains for non-RAG app features.
- **Consumer proof split:** `audit:consumer-rag-integrations` is a local source
  audit for Linkchat/Karte and Starboard. It now proves karte's profile-memory
  create/ingest/delete/search payload contract and Starboard's user-scoped
  semantic search plus full README-backed repo text content and
  `user_id`/`repo_id`/`full_name`/`language` ingest metadata contract, and
  requires Starboard's deterministic README-only recall plus bounded-ingest
  batching regression test, so description-only ingestion cannot pass the gate.
  It also
  fails if either consumer keeps the old
  `src/lib/rag-service.ts` client filename; the shared client module is
  `src/lib/knowledgebase.ts`. It verifies both checked-out consumer repos still
  expose a Cloudflare-backed `deploy:cf` script that runs the repo's Cloudflare
  build pipeline before deploy. `predeploy:local` includes both this source
  audit and local Cloudflare build verification for both consumers; the release
  plan exposes them as targeted re-runs after consumer-only changes. Karte and
  Starboard were deployed on 2026-06-22 with `RAG_SERVICE` bound to
  `knowledgebase` and the cutover `RAG_SERVICE_KEY` secret configured. Public
  app/auth-boundary smokes passed, and a Starboard-shaped direct knowledgebase
  ingest/query/delete smoke passed against the deployed Starboard index. Full
  in-app authenticated profile-memory and Starboard account sync smokes still
  require a browser/API user session.
- **High Signal:** phase-2 integration deferred (`docs/highsignal-integration.md`).
- **Sibling `rag-service`:** retired. Deleted on 2026-06-21 after
  `readiness:sibling-retirement` passed (deployed parity, fingerprint, auth+OCR,
  zero active external references, gap matrix consistent). `audit:sibling-rag-service
  --require-retired` now reports `retirement_ok: true` / `sibling_exists: false`.
  A source-only safety archive is kept at `../rag-service-retired-2026-06-21.tgz`.
  Do not recreate a separate `rag-service` Worker — all fleet RAG runtime lives in
  `cloudflare/worker`.
- **Deployed Worker cutover:** complete for the current embedding-model release.
  The live Worker version `a5ae4310-9091-42c8-8d22-5c26d7d09312` exposes
  `deploy_fingerprint=knowledgebase-cloudflare-embedding-models-2026-06-21`;
  public health/ready/metrics aliases return 200 and protected retired FastAPI
  aliases reject anonymous callers with 401. The matching `../free-ai` gateway
  version `14f263b7-67cf-4f8c-a213-7d83197a7fdc` is deployed, D1 migrations
  `0005_index_embedding_model.sql` and `0006_kb_domain_embedding_model.sql` are
  applied, all deployed free-ai embedding dimensions have Vectorize bindings and
  metadata indexes, read-only selected-model readiness is green, and
  `smoke:rag-crud:embedding-model` proves generic index CRUD plus the
  `/v1/kb/ingest/text` custom-input domain path and `/v1/kb/search`.
- **A+ evidence release:** deployed Worker version
  `eddbb682-d4c0-469b-a3e4-9ee9ac5b565d` exposes
  `deploy_fingerprint=knowledgebase-a-plus-evidence-2026-06-23`. Live
  Starboard-domain proof at `/tmp/kb-a-plus-proof-starboard-1782159455`
  passed overall A+ with readiness, scoped query eval, lexical `kb-search`,
  semantic `kb-query`, ingestion, observability, and hosted UI evidence.
  Final benchmark p95s: lexical `99.46 ms` (`server_p95_ms=0`) and semantic
  `550.73 ms` (`server_p95_ms=439`), with query eval hit/citation rates at
  `1.0`.
- **S-grade gate in progress:** non-UI S-grade evidence is now explicit in the
  Worker tooling. `scorecard:s` requires authenticated consumer smokes for Karte
  and Starboard, consumer eval packs for Karte memory and Starboard README
  retrieval, non-cache latency buckets, trace drilldown/export evidence,
  stricter retrieval quality/performance thresholds, and ingestion
  idempotency/replay/preview/failure-classification evidence before any category
  can be called S. `proof:s` plans the live S run against
  `fixtures/s-grade-consumer-evals.json` and includes the `consumer-auth-smokes`
  step. Current blocker for live S proof is not a Cloudflare runtime gap: it is
  missing `KARTE_SESSION_COOKIE` and `STARBOARD_SESSION_COOKIE` for authenticated
  product-session smokes. The ingestion reliability gate now has first-class
  Worker proof fields for idempotent content replay, chunk previews, replay
  routes, and failure classification.
- **Python runtime:** retired. The Worker full-port/preflight gates, UI,
  migration tooling, and local checks are TypeScript/Node-only; the old Python
  FastAPI server, Python UI, Docker Compose runtime, parser/query/eval package,
  package metadata, and root pytest suite have been removed.

```
Worker: Fleet consumer → Hono → free-ai/Workers AI embed → Vectorize query → D1 chunk text
        kb_* metadata on D1 for domains, schemas, files, jobs (migration 0003)
        staged R2 text/JSON/CSV-like files → domain Vectorize index → /v1/kb/search
        uploads create D1 ingest jobs; /v1/kb/ingest/run defaults to Workflow-backed Cloudflare Queue ingestion
        async:false is the explicit inline/debug override; queued/inline runs carry durable D1 workflow_id run identifiers
        ingest writes parse artifacts to R2 + D1
        file/source deletes remove Vectorize vectors, R2 raw artifacts, kb metadata, and core RAG chunks used by lexical search
        active inferred schemas extract structured entities/mentions/provenance into D1
        schema-inferred parent/ref fields, *_ids arrays, and prefixed cross-type fields create D1 entity relationships
        relationship resolution matches exact plus canonicalized identity/display-name aliases
        /v1/kb/relationships/backfill rebuilds graph edges for historical D1 entities from active schemas
        /v1/kb/entities/search provides a zero-AI D1 fast path for exact structured lookups
        /v1/kb/query plans explicit D1 field filters such as counterparty: Acme
        /v1/kb/query expands D1 structured matches with D1 relationship graph evidence
        explicit hybrid mode fuses D1 BM25-style fuzzy sparse lexical + Vectorize retrieval with RRF, local MMR, and opt-in Workers AI neural rerank
        hot KB search/query paths cache domain index lookups and lexical chunks to avoid repeated D1 external-id and LIKE-prefilter work
        query rewrite/decompose fans out lexical variants inside the Worker without extra AI
        semantic mode corrects low-score/empty Vectorize evidence with cached D1 lexical RRF fallback
        /v1/kb/query auto-uses the D1 entity fast path before Vectorize/Workers AI fallback
        /v1/kb/query returns fast extractive cited answers by default and opt-in Workers AI cited synthesis via answer_mode
        /v1/kb/query/stream preserves the retired FastAPI SSE stream contract with started/stage/answer/error events
        /v1/kb/query persists D1 query traces
        /v1/kb/query attaches deterministic answer/evidence verification to confidence
        /v1/kb/sessions stores D1-backed query sessions and bounded message history
        /v1/kb/evals/query scores answer hit rate, citation rate, deterministic faithfulness/support coverage, opt-in Workers AI judge scores, AI use rate, and latency
        eval reports persist to D1 and D1 rollups are exposed through /v1/kb/evals/summary
        query traces and eval reports emit compact RAG_ANALYTICS Analytics Engine data points
        query citations use deterministic question-token span selection before answer assembly
```

**Empirical headline:** On solid retrieval, `groq-llama-3.1-8b` beats `gemini-2.5-pro` by 24 pass-rate points on SEC eval — contingent on retrieval quality (see `NOTES.md` §4.7, `WRITEUP.md`).

## Timeline

- **D1 migrations:** core RAG tables, query cache, **`0003_knowledgebase_metadata.sql`** (`kb_*` projects/domains/schemas/files/jobs/chunks/sessions/traces), **`0005_index_embedding_model.sql`** for per-index embedding model/provider metadata, **`0006_kb_domain_embedding_model.sql`** for selected-model metadata on KB domains before auto-index creation, and **`0007_embedding_cache.sql`** for cross-isolate normalized query embedding reuse.
- **Eval maturity:** cross-domain 5×2 LLM eval matrix documented; methodology bugs caught and fixed (DuckDB route, env propagation, citation hygiene).
- **Fleet cutover:** SaaS Maker, Linkchat, Starboard on service binding; production SaaS Maker knowledge tables empty — no backfill required before rollout.
- **Frontend surfaces:** Astro landing deployed to Cloudflare Pages at
  `https://search.sassmaker.com`; Next.js/OpenNext dashboard
  deployed to Cloudflare Workers at
  `https://search.sassmaker.com`.
- **CI:** Worker-local `pnpm run predeploy:local` is the active local gate;
  it wraps typecheck/tests, binding preflight, Python retirement audit, local
  no-external-`rag-service` reference guard, consumer source audit and
  Cloudflare builds, free-ai catalog+deploy/vectorize audits, upstream free-ai
  cost/type/test check, the full-port gap matrix, the no-network NVDA scanned-PDF OCR eval payload
  dry-run, the read-only embedding-model release plan, deployed hosted UI
  readiness in `readiness:full-port`, Wrangler alias/fingerprint smoke, and
  deploy dry-run.

## Features (shipped)

### Cloudflare RAG_SERVICE (fleet shared worker)

- Index create/list/delete, document ingest/delete, vector query, query-by-vector; tenant isolation hardening.
- Service-key auth (`Authorization: Bearer` or `X-RAG-Key`); `RAG_SERVICE_KEYS` tenant mapping.
- Lexical auto-retrieval path meets p95/p99 targets for exact-term queries.
- Semantic path optimized (p95 <300 ms warmed; p99 cold outliers remain).
- `D1MetadataRepository` + full `/v1/kb/*` route set.
- Multipart upload → R2 + D1 registration; hosted testing UI.
- Hosted testing UI covers custom upload/input, direct structured-record
  ingestion with schema inference for new domains, schema-free inline
  domain-text ingestion, schema inference, ingestion,
  URL/EDGAR source import, parser options, source-set actions, sessions, traces,
  drilldowns, evals, and advanced query controls.
- TypeScript schema inference/draft/apply; retrieval eval route on Worker path.
- Nested JSON and quoted CSV record inference for arbitrary structured upload surfaces.
- Cloudflare-native parser slice for text/JSON/NDJSON/CSV, HTML, digital PDF text with coordinate-derived table rows, XLSX rows, DOCX paragraph text, and PPTX slide text; no Python parser runtime in the Worker.
- Legacy parse eval harness: `cloudflare/worker/scripts/legacy-parse-eval.mjs`
  builds parse-quality eval cases from the migrated D1 JSON export plus mirrored
  raw/parse object roots, batches large payloads, supports dry-run, bounded
  text previews, and filename/content-hash/case-id filters for targeted costly
  OCR reruns, can build a one-file direct case from local MinIO inline `xl.meta`
  raw/parse objects when no D1 export is available, supports `--require-cases`
  and `--min-pass-rate 1` as the final parity gate, and posts to
  `/v1/kb/evals/parse`. `pnpm run eval:parse:nvda-scanned:dry-run` verifies
  the local one-case payload without network or AI usage and prints the selected
  Cloudflare vision OCR model chain plus pass-rate gate; `pnpm run
  eval:parse:nvda-scanned:live` is the authenticated deployed one-case gate.
  `pnpm run readiness:full-port` requires deployed health/auth, deployed
  retired-route alias smokes, the expected deploy fingerprint, the live NVDA
  scanned-PDF OCR eval with `RAG_ALLOW_LIVE_OCR=1` or `--allow-live-ocr`, the
  Worker-local Node preflight, the sibling `rag-service` retirement audit, and
  the Worker-local Node full-port gap gate.
- Deployed parser parity evidence on Worker version
  `3099934b-54b6-44ef-9f57-994dc1550701`: legacy parse eval ran 19 migrated
  cases in 4 batches, passed 18/19 (94.74%), and skipped 3 JSON record files
  that had no legacy parse artifact. Passing coverage includes legal text,
  SEC HTML, digital PDF text/table rows, and XLSX rows/header wording. The one
  remaining failure is `NVDA_riskfactors_sample_scanned.pdf`: Cloudflare
  Markdown Conversion extracts/describes the image and matches the title, but
  does not transcribe the two expected risk-factor paragraphs from the legacy
  OCR artifact.
- Direct Workers AI image OCR is implemented as an opt-in parser fallback via
  `RAG_VISION_OCR_MODEL`, and upload schema inference, ingest runs, and parse
  evals can set `markdown_conversion`/`vision_ocr_model` per request without
  changing Worker secrets; queued and Workflow-backed ingestion preserve those
  parser options. It handles standalone JPEG/PNG/WebP uploads, embedded
  JPEG/JPX images, plus basic Flate RGB/grayscale PDF image streams converted
  to PNG, prioritizes page-like PDF images over tiny embedded assets, and runs
  for PDFs whose local text extraction is weak rather than only for completely
  textless PDFs. When vision and Markdown Conversion both return text the
  Worker stores a merged `workers-ai-vision-markdown-ocr-v1` artifact.
  It is not enabled by default:
  LLaVA took ~71.8 s for the scanned PDF and still missed the target
  paragraphs. The direct parse-eval harness can now build the local
  `NVDA_riskfactors_sample_scanned.pdf` case from MinIO inline metadata without
  a D1 export. The Worker now accepts a comma-separated Cloudflare vision model
  chain: Llama 3.2 Vision tries Workers AI native `prompt` + image bytes first
  and falls back to an `image_url` message, while Llama 4 Scout uses the
  `image_url` message shape. The packaged NVDA live gate tries
  `@cf/meta/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct` first, then
  `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`; parse evals retry later configured
  models when the first model returns text but still misses expected OCR
  snippets. The deployed live OCR gate has been run: `readiness:full-port` with
  `RAG_ALLOW_LIVE_OCR=1` passed `nvda-scanned-ocr-live` with pass_rate 1 on the
  deployed Worker, closing the scanned-PDF gap on the Cloudflare vision model chain.
- Cloudflare Workflow plus Queue is the primary `/v1/kb/ingest/run` path when
  bound, with direct Queue fallback and `async:false` as an explicit inline/debug
  override.
- Durable ingest run IDs in D1 `workflow_id`, propagated through Workflow
  instances, Queue messages, and job state.
- Run-level queued ingestion progress via `/v1/kb/ingest/runs/:run_id`, exposed in the hosted testing UI.
- Domain-backed source-set summaries and bulk dry-run/requeue/archive/delete actions, exposed in the hosted testing UI.
- File/source deletes clean Vectorize vectors, raw R2 objects, metadata rows, and core RAG chunks so lexical search cannot return deleted corpus text.
- Schema-inferred structured entity relationship extraction, prior-ingest target
  resolution, prefixed cross-type entity extraction, and `/v1/kb/relationships`
  inspection.
- Deterministic identity/display-name alias resolution for D1 relationship
  matching.
- Historical D1 entity graph repair through `/v1/kb/relationships/backfill`.
- Zero-AI D1 exact field-filter planning in `/v1/kb/query` for structured entity fields.
- Zero-AI D1 graph evidence expansion in `/v1/kb/query` for structured entity matches.
- Explicit `hybrid` retrieval mode with D1 BM25-style fuzzy sparse lexical + Vectorize RRF fusion plus Worker-native keyword rerank/MMR and opt-in Workers AI neural rerank.
- Cached KB domain index lookup plus cached-chunk lexical scoring for hot `/v1/kb/search` and `/v1/kb/query` paths.
- Strong lexical precheck for `semantic` queries returns high-confidence zero-AI sparse matches before embedding/Vectorize, preserving semantic fallback for weak lexical evidence.
- Deterministic rewrite/decompose lexical fanout for multi-part questions, exposed through Worker API/UI flags for benchmark comparison.
- Corrective semantic fallback: explicit `semantic` queries with low-score/empty Vectorize evidence fuse cached lexical evidence before returning.
- Opt-in Workers AI answer synthesis for `/v1/kb/query` through `answer_mode: "workers_ai"`, with extractive cited answers kept as the default fast path.
- SSE query lifecycle parity through `/v1/kb/query/stream`, exposed in the
  hosted testing UI as Stream Answer and backed by the same answer path as
  `/v1/kb/query`.
- Retired FastAPI route compatibility through authenticated Worker aliases for
  root agent/search/query paths and product prefixes; `pnpm run
  audit:legacy-route-parity` is a Node-only release gate and is included in
  Worker preflight.
- Python runtime retirement through a Node-only audit for the old FastAPI
  package, Python UI, Docker runtime, Python package metadata, root pytest
  suite, and Python helper scripts; `pnpm run preflight` runs this gate.
- D1-backed query sessions tied to `/v1/kb/query` traces and exposed in the hosted testing UI.
- D1-backed trace export and deterministic trace comparison routes exposed in the hosted testing UI.
- Deterministic answer-quality trace drilldowns exposed through `/v1/kb/query/trace/:id/drilldown` and the hosted testing UI.
- Persisted query trace timing stages and empty-result diagnostics in trace confidence for operator observability reports.
- Dependency-free typed `KnowledgebaseClient` for custom text ingestion, search, and query integrations.
- Deterministic question-token span selection for `/v1/kb/query` citations without extra AI calls.
- Inline deterministic answer/evidence verification in `/v1/kb/query` confidence, persisted into D1 query traces without extra AI calls.
- D1 eval report history and rollups via `/v1/kb/evals/reports` and `/v1/kb/evals/summary`, including deterministic answer faithfulness/support coverage metrics and opt-in Workers AI model-judged support scores.
- Analytics Engine data points for successful query traces and eval reports via the `RAG_ANALYTICS` dataset binding.
- A/A+/S scorecard gate (`pnpm run scorecard:a-plus`, `pnpm run scorecard:s`)
  grades reliability,
  deploy readiness, retrieval performance, retrieval quality, ingestion
  reliability, observability, and ease-of-use evidence from readiness reports,
  operator reports, and benchmarks so missing proof cannot be mistaken for
  production excellence. `pnpm run proof:a-plus` generates the deployed
  readiness, deterministic query eval, operator, lexical search, semantic
  answer, and scorecard JSON proof bundle for one domain, and fail-fasts after
  readiness if the deployed fingerprint/health checks are stale before spending
  eval or benchmark requests. The proof runner also validates at least two
  labeled benchmark/eval queries locally before any live request, and the
  scorecard consumes fresh query eval hit/citation rates directly with domain
  and row-count checks. Query evals honor expected text, document IDs, and
  chunk IDs so non-empty retrieval cannot inflate labeled hit rates. Operator
  reports automatically prove hosted UI, custom text input, async progress, and
  user-visible UI copy that hides retrieval/storage internals, and now verify
  trace drilldown/export APIs when traces exist. `benchmark:rag`
  emits mode-labeled lexical/semantic/hybrid evidence for index, domain search,
  and domain answer surfaces with cache-hit and non-cache latency buckets, and
  the scorecard CLI can merge an operator report plus repeated benchmark files
  without hand-built JSON. The scorecard can also require a target domain plus
  specific benchmark modes, benchmark surfaces, and eval report kinds, with
  minimum repeat/sample counts for benchmark reports, so narrow,
  under-sampled, cached-only, or wrong-account proof cannot masquerade as
  across-the-board evidence. It can also require the expected deploy fingerprint
  so stale production reports fail inside the gate.
- Public `/readyz` and Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` compatibility endpoints
  for the retired FastAPI meta surface, backed by Cloudflare D1/Vectorize/R2
  binding checks.
- Benchmark harnesses, backfill script (`scripts/backfill-saas-maker.mjs`), checksum-reporting raw R2/D1 migration script (`scripts/migrate-raw-files.mjs`), smoke export script, route tests, readiness checks.
- Raw-file migration guardrails: `scripts/migrate-raw-files.mjs` accepts local,
  manifest, or mirrored MinIO/S3 object exports, rejects direct MinIO
  disk/erasure layouts containing `xl.meta`, and the local legacy MinIO mirror
  accounts for 48 files / 20,395,043 bytes across 5 domains. Those raw files
  were uploaded to R2 under both legacy filename-suffixed keys and current
  hash-only Worker keys. The legacy parse prefix contributed 34 artifacts, also
  uploaded to R2. Remote verification fetched and hash-checked all
  D1-referenced raw files (22) and parse artifacts (28).
- D1 metadata migration guardrails: `scripts/migrate-d1-metadata.mjs` now
  derives missing legacy mention/provenance domains from referenced rows,
  orders self-referenced entities/chunks before children, supports
  `--no-transaction` for remote D1 imports, and turns the real local Postgres
  export into 2,199 D1 rows that apply cleanly to a disposable D1-shaped SQLite
  database. The same import has been applied to remote D1 with matching table
  counts. Authenticated Worker route smokes now read migrated
  domains/status/entities/parse-artifact metadata.
- Auth hardening for verification/cutover: Worker version
  `62d62f04-dc91-4fd7-aadc-ad85be589852` supports
  `RAG_SERVICE_KEYS_APPEND`, an append-only secret map that allows temporary
  verification keys without overwriting the primary fleet `RAG_SERVICE_KEYS`.
- Python runtime retirement: the old Python FastAPI server, Python UI, Docker
  Compose runtime, parser/query/eval package, package metadata, and root pytest
  suite have been removed; the active product/tooling surface is the
  Cloudflare Worker package.

## Todo / Planned / Deferred / Blocked

### Planned

1. Add richer eval trend views per project/kind/filter on top of the persisted
   Worker eval reports.
2. Framework-specific agent integration examples + HTTP contract compatibility test.
3. Live progress UI while schema inference itself is parsing representative
   files in the Worker `/ui`.
4. Deeper source-set management: cursors, stale counts, and bulk replace.
5. Project templates (papers, company knowledge, notes, manuals, contracts, docs snapshots).
6. Schema-diff and safe reprocess wizard in UI.
7. Keep post-cutover regression gates current whenever Worker routes, parser/OCR
   behavior, or fleet RAG consumers change: `pnpm run check`,
   `pnpm run gaps:full-port -- --json`, `pnpm run audit:sibling-rag-service
   -- --json`, and deployed `smoke:legacy-routes --require-complete`.
8. Finish hosting checklist: durable storage, backups, observability, usage limits, smoke tests.
9. Enable AI Gateway cache when Wrangler OAuth unblocks gateway creation.
10. Complete live S-grade consumer proof with
   `KARTE_SESSION_COOKIE=<cookie> STARBOARD_SESSION_COOKIE=<cookie> pnpm run
   smoke:consumer-auth -- --require-authenticated`, then re-run `proof:s`
   against the deployed Worker.
11. Add first-class ingest idempotency and failure-classification proof so the
   ingestion category can move from A+ to S without relying on route presence.

### Deferred

- **Public multi-user hosting** — until auth, per-project authorization, upload limits, rate limits, job cancellation, backup drills, log redaction.
- **Connector marketplace** — manual/private corpus search remains the wedge.
- **High Signal integration** — phase-2; storage/ingest ownership must be decided first.
- **Per-project service key rotation UI.**
- **Queue/workflow ingestion at scale** on Worker.
- **Exact Qdrant BM42 model equivalence on Worker** — Cloudflare Vectorize does not provide BM42. Product retrieval parity uses the Cloudflare-native replacement: Vectorize dense search, D1 fuzzy sparse lexical scoring, semantic/hybrid RRF, MMR, opt-in Workers AI neural rerank, rewrite/decompose, and D1 graph expansion.
- **Semantic p99 <300 ms on completely unique cold misses** — query-result and normalized embedding caches now cover hot/repeated questions across Worker isolates, but first-seen semantic misses still pay embedding plus Vectorize latency before the caches can help.

### Blocked

- Future product additions must land in the Worker/D1 repository and `/v1/kb/*` aliases before being considered product-complete.
- Raw local MinIO objects and parse artifacts have been uploaded to remote R2
  and verified against D1-referenced hashes. Authenticated Worker route-level
  upload/ingest smoke remains part of the broader route verification gap.
- Legacy Postgres metadata has been imported into remote D1 and verified by
  direct D1 counts plus authenticated Worker route-level reads.
- AI Gateway cache implemented but not enabled (Wrangler OAuth blocked gateway creation).
- Cloudflare Vectorize is not Qdrant BM42; the accepted Worker replacement is D1 fuzzy sparse lexical + Vectorize dense RRF with optional Workers AI rerank.
- Workers cannot host the old OCR/parser stack as-is; text/HTML/digital-PDF-table/XLSX/DOCX/PPTX parsing is now TypeScript-native, and opt-in vision OCR can be merged with Markdown Conversion. Exact scanned-PDF OCR parity is proven on the Cloudflare vision model chain by the deployed NVDA scanned-PDF gate.
- Worker name: `knowledgebase` on Cloudflare; D1 id in `wrangler.jsonc`.
- Consumers must set `RAG_SERVICE_KEY` + service binding or `RAG_SERVICE_URL` fallback.
- `cloudflare/full-port-gaps.json` is the executable full-port gap matrix. Use
  `cd cloudflare/worker && pnpm run gaps:full-port` for the Node-only Worker
  release gate. It currently reports 0 remaining local full-port gaps; the
  production embedding-model release has completed free-ai deploy, D1 migration,
  Worker deploy, Vectorize provisioning, and live smoke. Keep this gate as the
  regression check for future changes.
- `cloudflare/worker/scripts/preflight.mjs` is the Node-only Cloudflare binding,
  legacy-route-parity, and Python runtime retirement preflight for release
  readiness.
