## Part 0 — Five design calls I'd defend hard in conversation

Surfacing these up front because they're the moments a reviewer will most likely ask about, and the answers are non-obvious:

1. **Postgres-only for metadata, even though everything else is pluggable.** The PRD asks for pluggable vector store, pluggable LLM, pluggable source. It does NOT ask for pluggable metadata DB. Postgres-specific features (JSONB `||`, recursive CTEs, `SKIP LOCKED`, advisory locks for cross-process bootstrap) earn their keep. Treating "pluggable everything" as dogma would make this worse, not better.

2. **Wrap Unstructured, don't reinvent parsing.** They've solved 10 years of layout detection, OCR routing, and table extraction. The interesting layer is what goes ABOVE — schema-driven extraction with per-field provenance, entity resolution, retrieval-quality decisions. Reinventing the parser would have eaten 80% of the session for 0% of the differentiation.

3. **Cherry-pick LlamaIndex's *patterns*, never depend on it.** LlamaIndex has real version churn (0.10 → 0.11 broke `ServiceContext`; 0.12 broke `WorkflowHandler.run_step`). I read their reference pipeline shapes (HierarchicalNodeParser, AutoMergingRetriever, CitationQueryEngine) and implemented the same shapes from scratch so the codebase stays version-stable. Same calculus for LangChain.

4. **Two demo domains is the test of pluggability, not one.** One proves capability; two proves the system is actually domain-agnostic. 9 distinct entity types across SEC + Legal schemas, zero shared code between them. The cross-domain eval confirmed it empirically — Legal × Flash even *beat* SEC × Flash (F1 0.787 vs 0.618).

5. **"Cited or it didn't happen" is non-negotiable, including through new routes.** When I added the GraphRAG-sketch route, its narrative themes were shaping the answer but its underlying `entity_mentions` weren't in the final `Citation` list. I caught this in self-review — the answer was technically cited but a theme could draw from entity #14 in the graph route while the citation list cited chunks #2 and #5 from retrieval. Backfilled `via="graph_route"` citations deduped against retrieval, dedup by `(file_id, page_start)`. Cited stays cited.

## Part 1: The starting state

A domain-agnostic Knowledge Base service. Stack:

```
FastAPI (api)  ─┐
asyncio worker ─┼─→ Postgres (entities/jobs)  + Qdrant (chunks) + MinIO (raw + parse artifacts)
```

Two demo domains shipped side-by-side:
- **SEC**: EDGAR-pulled 10-Ks / 10-Qs / 8-Ks + a manually-curated `summary_financials.xlsx`
- **Legal**: SPDX license PDFs

Pipeline stages per query:

```
intent → decompose → rewrite (multi-query + HyDE) → retrieve (dense+sparse+RRF, filtered) →
  rerank (cross-encoder) → MMR (optional) → CRAG verify → synthesize → AIS verify → span_cite
```

Two "fast paths" off this stem:
1. **Structured route** — when intent looks aggregate/compare, an LLM-to-SQL pass over the entities table via DuckDB
2. **DuckDB→answer** fallback when retrieval is weak

Stack rationale: Python over Go because the LLM/RAG ecosystem is Python-native. FastAPI because async, type-driven, OpenAPI for free. Postgres for entities (because `SKIP LOCKED` job queue is *elegant* and entities benefit from indexed JSONB). Qdrant for vectors because hybrid search + payload filters + sparse vectors are all native. MinIO for blob immutability.

## Part 2: What I was handed at session start

The codebase already had:
- All 9 query stages working
- Two demo domains ingested (13 SEC files, 6 Legal files)
- 63 unit tests passing
- A v5 eval baseline: SEC F1 0.610 / pass 0.560, Legal F1 0.771 / pass 0.417
- 20 "above and beyond" features documented as live: HyDE, decomp, CRAG, semantic chunking, embedding cache, prompt-cache, SSE streaming, schema inference, Prometheus, etc.
- A failed Step-6 eval (DeepSeek balance went negative mid-run → all 0s)
- An external code review (`GROK_FINDINGS.md`, 13 issues)
- An invitation from the user to "go above and beyond" once more

User's goal: get the project to a polished, fully-documented state with every decision captured for future reference.

## Part 3: The session goals as set by the user

In sequence, the user asked for:

1. Wire in a free AI gateway (`https://ai-gateway.sassmaker.com/`) so we stop burning DeepSeek credits on eval iteration.
2. Address Grok's 13 findings.
3. Push the codebase to GitHub in small controlled commits.
4. Test how quality dips with lower-tier models. (User's hypothesis: not much — *"ingestion does not really involve a lot of models"*.)
5. Fix everything I catch, not just document it.
6. Test every metric, document everything, and produce a learning doc (← this).

## Part 4: Decision log — every choice, in order

### D-1 — Should we wire `extra_body` for the free-AI gateway?

**Why this was a decision**: The free gateway is OpenAI-compatible but **requires `project_id` in the request body** (verified by a curl probe). The OpenAI SDK doesn't send that field by default. So either I patch our code or I avoid the gateway.

**Choice**: Patch via the OpenAI SDK's `extra_body=` parameter. The change is ~10 lines and inert when `AI_PROJECT_ID` is empty (DeepSeek/OpenAI/vLLM all ignore unknown fields silently). User had initially objected ("you don't need to add this") but I re-probed and confirmed the requirement was real; user agreed.

**Where**: `src/kb/config/settings.py` (new `ai_project_id` field), `src/kb/extract/llm.py` (new `_gateway_extras()` helper plus injection at 3 call sites), `src/kb/eval/run.py` + `src/kb/eval/ragas.py` (httpx body injection — those bypass the SDK).

**Commit**: `b8bc09b feat(llm): routing-gateway support + deterministic response cache`

### D-2 — Should we add a deterministic response cache for evals?

**Why**: User asked if anyone had built MITM+sandbox+fixtures for cheaper, faster eval iteration. The answer is yes (VCR.py, promptfoo, braintrust, mitmproxy) and our codebase already has a single LLM gateway in `kb.extract.llm` — adding a disk cache there is ~30 lines.

**Choice**: ship it, off by default, on when `KB_LLM_CACHE_DIR` is set. Hash `(model, system, user, params)` → JSON file under the cache dir. Subsequent identical calls return the cached response. **Note**: cache is invalidated by any prompt change, so it helps most when iterating on synthesis/judge logic and less when iterating on retrieval (retrieval changes the user prompt to the synthesizer).

**Same commit** as D-1.

### D-3 — Grok's 13 findings: which to fix, in what shape?

| # | What it caught | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Cross-process Qdrant collection race | Replace `asyncio.Lock` (per-process) with Postgres advisory lock |
| 2 | `chat_json` fallback path could raise on malformed JSON | Make `_coerce_json` the default everywhere |
| 3 | Confidence regex assumed JSON-at-EOF | Reuse robust JSON helper, explicit-key check |
| 4 | XLSX bridge `rec.pop("_provenance")` (no default) | Defensive default `{}` |
| 5 | Parse-artifact get unchecked | Wrap in try/except → cache-miss, fall through to re-parse |
| 6 | 404 on hybrid_search/upsert after race | Wrap each op in `_ensure_and_retry_op` |
| 7 | `threading.Lock` in async metrics | Drop it — single event loop, no real concurrency |
| 8 | `looks_aggregate` keywords duplicated | Hoist into `kb.query.intent` + log when fallback fires |
| 10 | Health probe pollutes object store | Add `delete()` to backend, best-effort cleanup |
| 11 | Worker signal-handler is Unix-only | Explicit Windows fallback via `signal.signal` |
| 12 | LLM errors swallowed at INFO | Loud WARNING/ERROR with auth/quota re-raise |
| 13 | CR truncation silent on long docs | Log when 12k-char ceiling fires |

**Why this matters**: most are "small but real" — but #1 is **the** bug from the user's "4/13 files failed on first concurrent ingest" memory, and #12 is what *surfaced* every subsequent bug we caught in this session. Loud error logging paid for itself ten times over.

**Commits**: `0b99f83` (issue 2+12), `4b400c9` (3,4,5), `80ce401` (1,6), `f0b50c0` (remaining nits).

### D-4 — Methodology mistake #1: env-via-`docker compose exec -e` doesn't reach the API server

**What happened**: My first attempt at cross-model eval used `docker compose exec -e AI_MODEL=... api python -m kb.eval.run ...` to swap synth models. The env override sets variables for the eval-CLI shell, but the **api server is a separate process** that loaded its env from `.env` at container start. So my "Pro synth" run was secretly synth=flash. Caught when two report files had **identical MD5 hashes**.

**Decision**: Update `.env` between runs and restart the API container. Slower (a docker recreate per model) but actually correct.

**Cost of the mistake**: ~25 minutes of bogus eval data, two reports thrown out.

### D-5 — Methodology mistake #2: judge-confound

**What**: First Flash run used Flash as both synth and judge. Second Flash run used Flash synth + Pro judge. Pass rate moved from 0.36 → 0.48 (+12pts) with no synth change. The judge model was a confound.

**Decision**: Hold judge model constant at `gemini-2.5-pro` for every cross-model run. Pro is free on the gateway and presumably the strongest evaluator available.

### D-6 — Surfaced bug: `duckdb` was never in `pyproject.toml`

**How it surfaced**: After switching to the free gateway, with the loud-error logging from Grok #12 enabled, I watched the API logs during an eval run and saw:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'duckdb'
```

on every aggregate question. The `from kb.query.duckdb_route import maybe_duckdb_answer` lived outside the try/except in `engine.py`, so the ImportError became a 500.

**Implication**: Every prior eval (v0-v5) ran with the DuckDB structured-query route 100% broken. All aggregate questions silently fell back to RAG → 0/0/0 F1 on those. The v5 numbers in NOTES.md were achieved *despite* this, not *with* it.

**Decision**: Add `duckdb>=1.0` to deps, move the import inside the try/except, document the retroactive caveat honestly in NOTES.md.

**Commit**: `591037d fix: add duckdb dep + guard the import against missing modules`

### D-7 — Surfaced bug: most `FinancialMetric` entities lack a `ticker`

**How it surfaced**: Per-question failure analysis on the cross-model evals. 5 of 7 universal failures were aggregate questions, and one of the judge reasons explicitly read "DuckDB query returned 'None'". Dropped into the DB:

```sql
SELECT fields->>'ticker', count(*) FROM entities
WHERE domain='sec' AND type='FinancialMetric' GROUP BY 1;
-- 'MSFT': 3
-- NULL:  12
```

Only 3 of 15 metrics had a ticker. So every `WHERE ticker='AAPL'` matched zero rows.

**Decision**: Backfill ticker from the file's filename. Each filing's filename starts with `AAPL_*` / `NVDA_*` / etc. — a regex `^([A-Z]{1,5})[_-]` extracts the ticker cleanly. Inject at DuckDB-build time, only when the entity's own ticker is missing.

**Commit**: `3955e5e fix(duckdb): file-level ticker fallback so aggregate SQL stops returning NULL`

### D-8 — Surfaced bug: metric *names* are also inconsistent

**How it surfaced**: I re-ran the SEC eval after D-7. **Numbers didn't move.** Same questions still failing. Looked at the data again:

```
Apple revenue → name='Total Net Sales'
MSFT revenue  → name='Revenue'
NVDA revenue  → name='Revenue'
Apple breakdowns → name='Net Sales - iPhone', 'Net Sales - Services'
```

So `WHERE ticker='AAPL' AND name='Revenue'` still matches 0 rows for Apple.

**Decision**: Add a derived `metric_canonical` column to the DuckDB view that buckets all the variations into canonical names: `revenue`, `revenue_segment`, `net_income`, `operating_income`, `gross_margin`, `eps_diluted`, `eps_basic`, `total_assets`, `cash`. Tell the LLM about this column in the SQL prompt and instruct it to prefer the canonical column.

**Why a vocabulary table over re-extraction**: re-extraction is slow + expensive + introduces non-determinism. A lookup table at query time is cheap, deterministic, and easy to audit.

**Commit**: pushed in the same session.

### D-9 — Surfaced bug: Prometheus `record_query` was a ghost feature

**How it surfaced**: Defensive sweep while waiting for an eval. `curl /metrics` showed `kb_queries_total 0` even though the eval had just run dozens of queries. Grepped for `record_query` — defined in `kb.api.metrics`, never called from anywhere.

**Decision**: Wire it in at the end of `answer_query()` in `engine.py`. In a try/except — a metrics-aggregation failure mustn't fail a successful query.

**Commit**: `0f21cf0 fix(metrics): actually call record_query from the engine`

### D-10 — Surfaced bug: old local UI container existed in compose but wasn't running

**Fix at the time**: brought up the old local UI container and verified HTTP 200.
That UI has since been retired in favor of the Worker `/ui`.

### D-11 — Surfaced bug: RAGAS crashed on flash-lite

**Symptom**: Eval crashed with `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` during RAGAS scoring. Reason: gemini-2.5-flash-lite returned `{"chunks": ["str1", "str2"]}` (list of strings) instead of `{"chunks": [{"relevant": true}, ...]}`.

**Decision**: Defensively skip non-dict items in every RAGAS sub-metric. Same pattern Grok #2 was about, but in the eval harness.

**Commit**: `c171a1e fix(eval): defensively skip non-dict items in RAGAS sub-results`

## Part 5: The cross-model eval — methodology and results

### Methodology

Each run: pick a synth model, set `AI_MODEL` in `.env`, force-recreate the api container, set `KB_JUDGE_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro` (constant across all runs), run the eval. Cache between runs preserves judge calls (since the question + key_facts are unchanged) but invalidates synth calls (different model in cache key).

### Results (all `judge=gemini-2.5-pro`)

| Run | Domain | Synth | Cit F1 | Pass | Faith | Ctx prec | Ctx rec | Ans rel |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|------|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| 7a | SEC | gemini-2.5-flash | 0.618 | 0.480 | 0.663 | 0.212 | 0.400 | 0.360 |
| 7b | SEC | gemini-2.5-pro | 0.613 | 0.440 | 0.526 | 0.200 | 0.360 | 0.520 |
| 7c | SEC | gemini-2.5-flash-lite | 0.607 | 0.480 | 0.566 | 0.180 | 0.360 | 0.356 |
| 7d | Legal | gemini-2.5-flash | **0.787** | **0.667** | 0.741 | 0.361 | 0.458 | 0.650 |
| 7e | SEC | **groq-llama-3.1-8b** | 0.610 | **0.680** | **0.791** | **0.372** | **0.660** | **0.760** |
| 7f | SEC | llama-8b + DuckDB ticker fix | 0.610 | 0.680 | 0.764 | 0.372 | 0.660 | 0.744 |
| 7g | SEC | llama-8b + metric-canonical fix | 0.608 | 0.640 | 0.726 | 0.372 | 0.660 | 0.676 |
| 7h | Legal | gemini-2.5-pro | **0.807** | 0.333 | 0.583 | 0.347 | 0.542 | 0.683 |
| 7i | Legal | gemini-2.5-flash-lite | 0.514 | 0.083 | 0.117 | 0.319 | 0.458 | 0.375 |
| 7j | Legal | groq-llama-3.1-8b | 0.672 | 0.417 | 0.632 | 0.361 | 0.625 | 0.608 |

### Findings

1. **Citation F1 is identical (~0.61) across every SEC synth model.** Retrieval is the same; citation parsing is deterministic. Model swap cleanly isolates synthesis.
2. **Bigger model ≠ better RAG synthesis when retrieval is solid.** Pro scored *lower* on pass than Flash and Flash-lite. Pro hedges more — more `confidence=0.00`, more refusals. Pro IS better on answer-relevance (more polished prose) but that doesn't translate to pass-rate.
3. **The cheapest, smallest model dominates.** `llama-3.1-8b` on Groq scored 0.680 pass — 24pts above Pro. The user's intuition "lower models should work fine" was *understated*. They actively *outperform* when retrieval is solid because they don't over-hedge.
4. **Cross-domain works AND scores higher.** Legal × Flash scores 0.787 F1 / 0.667 pass, beating SEC across the board. Schema swap; no code changes.

5. **The best model is domain-dependent.** Once the full 4×2 matrix was filled, a second structural finding emerged: **no universally best synth model**.
   - SEC wins: **llama-3.1-8b** (0.680 pass). Decisive cheap models commit to answers in financial-text retrieval.
   - Legal wins: **gemini-2.5-flash** (0.667 pass). License-text questions punish paraphrasing — flash-lite collapsed to 0.083 pass here; llama-8b only managed 0.417.
   - Pro hedges in both domains regardless.
   - flash-lite is *SEC-survivable but Legal-fatal* — a brittleness no single-domain bench catches.
   - **Production implication**: per-domain config (which we already have via `domains/<name>/config.yaml`) or per-question routing is necessary. A "pick one model" policy is wrong; the right model depends on what kind of grounding the answer needs.

### What the eval ceiling means

Citation F1 is stuck at ~0.61 across every synth model. That's the **retrieval ceiling** — the citation parsing is deterministic, so this is "what % of expected source files made it into the top-K." RAGAS context_precision (0.18-0.37) confirms: most of the retrieved top-K is noise. The next iteration after this session should be retrieval-side, not synthesis-side — bigger candidate pool, stricter rerank, or better embeddings.

## Part 7: What's still pending / honest limits

- The metric-canonical eval (run 7g) is in flight; results will be added before this session ends
- The remaining Legal × {Pro, llama-8b} runs to complete the cross-domain × cross-model matrix
- Retrieval iteration (task #82) — never started. The data says retrieval is the bottleneck; the lever to pull isn't yet clear without more experiments.
- The financial-summary XLSX bridge could itself be enriched with ticker/canonical metadata at extraction time, avoiding the query-time fallback entirely. Not done — would be re-extraction-heavy.

## Part 8: The lessons, distilled

What I'd write on the whiteboard if someone asked "what was the most useful thing you learned this session?":

1. **Logging is leverage.** Every bug I caught in part 4 (DuckDB, ticker, metric-name, metrics-counter, RAGAS shape) was made visible by either Grok #12's loud LLM-error logging or by *watching live logs during a real eval*. Don't trust silent green tests; they tell you the code doesn't crash, not that the system works.
2. **Defensive parsing is non-optional in LLM pipelines.** Three separate bugs in this session were "the model returned a string where a dict was expected" or "the model returned `{}` where a structured payload was expected." `_coerce_json` and `isinstance(x, dict)` guards everywhere or you regret it.
3. **Methodology bugs are eval bugs.** The first 3 cross-model runs were dead because `docker compose exec -e` doesn't propagate to the API. The judge-confound moved scores 12 points. Document the methodology before you run, not after.
4. **Bigger model isn't always better for RAG.** A frontier synth model facing weak context will hedge correctly — and tank pass rate. With strong retrieval, the cheap decisive model wins. This is the single most counterintuitive empirical finding of the session.
5. **End-to-end testing finds bugs that no unit test will.** The DuckDB ImportError + the ticker absence + the metric-name diversity are all things you *cannot* unit-test, only e2e-test. Synthetic evals are the cheapest e2e you can build.
