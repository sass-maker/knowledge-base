>
> ### Step 7 honest scars uncovered
>
> 1. **DuckDB structured-query route was 100% broken in v0-v5.** `duckdb` was
>    missing from `pyproject.toml`; the `import` lived outside the try/except
>    in `engine.py`, so every aggregate question returned 500. All v5 numbers
>    were achieved with this route effectively dead. Fixed in commit `591037d`.
> 2. **Most FinancialMetric entities lacked `ticker`** (3 of 15). DuckDB SQL
>    `WHERE ticker='AAPL'` filtered to zero rows. Fixed in commit `3955e5e`
>    via filename-prefix fallback.
> 3. **Metric names are inconsistent** across companies (Apple "Total Net Sales"
>    vs MSFT "Revenue"). Added derived `metric_canonical` column. Fix correct
>    behaviorally but on this 25-question dataset the lift was within
>    noise (eval noise floor measured at ±1 question = ±4pts pass).
> 4. **Prometheus `record_query` was a ghost feature** — defined, never called.
>    Now actually fires (commit `0f21cf0`).
> 5. **The free-AI gateway needs `project_id` in the request body** — added
>    via OpenAI SDK's `extra_body=` (commit `b8bc09b`).
>
> ### Step 7 cross-model × cross-domain matrix (judge=gemini-2.5-pro constant)
>
> See § 4.7 of NOTES.md for the live-filling matrix. Headline already in:
>
> - **Citation F1 ~0.61 across every SEC synth model** — retrieval is the
>   bottleneck, citation parsing is deterministic
> - **`llama-3.1-8b` dominates Pro by +24pts on pass** — bigger model ≠ better
>   for RAG synthesis when retrieval is solid; Pro hedges, llama commits
> - **Legal × Flash hits 0.787 F1 / 0.667 pass**, beating SEC across the board

Captured 2026-05-26 against the running stack with all upgrades enabled.

## Stack

```
kb-api        Up
kb-minio      Up (healthy)
kb-postgres   Up (healthy)
kb-qdrant     Up
old local UI container was up during this historical run
kb-worker     Up
```

`GET /readyz` → db / vector (qdrant) / object (minio) all OK.

## Seed corpus — 13 documents, 4 formats, ~10 MB

```
HTML  (10)  10 real EDGAR filings via the `edgar` source adapter
            NVDA 10-K x2, 10-Q x2, 8-K x2; AAPL 10-K x1, 10-Q x2, 8-K x1
            Sizes: 20 KB (small 8-Ks) → 2.0 MB (10-Ks)
PDF   (2)   1 digital (reportlab text-layer), 1 scanned (image-only → tesseract OCR)
XLSX  (1)   summary_financials.xlsx (per-row chunked)
```

Format span: ~100× size range. OCR path exercised. All 13 reach `status: ready` in ~4 min.

## Schema-driven extraction (live counts)

```
Company           2     (Apple Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA)
Filing            6     (form_type typed against enum)
FinancialMetric   8
RiskFactor       11     (category typed: regulatory, market, supply_chain, …)
Section          11
```

## Chunk-level deduplication (new)

When the same text appears across multiple files (boilerplate, recycled
paragraphs), the system stores **one** Qdrant point and tracks the extra
sources on `also_in_files`. Every citation that resolves to that point carries
every source file via `Citation.also_in`.

```
chunks indexed in qdrant         : 2,748
chunks with non-empty also_in    : ~15% on a 200-chunk scroll of SEC
example payload                  : primary=NVDA_10-K_2026-02-25,
                                   also_in=[NVDA_10-K_2025-02-26,
                                            NVDA_10-Q_2026-05-20,
                                            NVDA_10-Q_2025-11-19]
```

Diagnostic query "What does NVIDIA say about U.S. export controls?" —
the cited paragraph appears in 4 filings; the answer's first citation reads
`NVDA_10-Q_2025-11-19 — also in: NVDA_10-Q_2026-05-20`.

## Query pipeline (each stage on every trace)

```
intent      LLM classifies kind (lookup | aggregate | compare | negative) + extracts facets
structured  if aggregate/compare, run SQL against entities table directly (with provenance)
retrieve    hybrid Qdrant: dense + (sparse where available), candidate pool 30
rerank      cross-encoder ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 narrows to MMR pool of 16
mmr         maximal marginal relevance picks top K with diversity penalty
synthesize  cited LLM answer with strict refusal-on-no-citation
verify      per-claim entailment check; downgrades confidence on unsupported claims
span_cite   per-citation span chosen via dense cosine; multi-source aware
```

Each stage is timed and goes on `/query/trace/{id}` with token counts for the
synthesize stage. The active Worker UI renders the decomposition as a row of
latency cards.

### Example trace

## Eval — two domains, real LLM, full upgrade stack

Final numbers after Contextual Retrieval + DuckDB route + RAGAS metrics:

| Domain | n | Citation F1 | Answer pass | RAGAS faithfulness | RAGAS context_precision | RAGAS answer_relevance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sec`   | 25 | **0.610** | **0.560** (14/25) | 0.400 | 0.268 | 0.784 |
| `legal` | 12 | **0.771** | **0.417** (5/12)  | 0.375 | 0.264 | 0.750 |

### The headline finding

RAGAS metrics are **almost identical across the two unrelated domains**
(faithfulness ~0.39, context_precision ~0.27, answer_relevance ~0.77).
That converging signal says the bottleneck is structural — the **retrieval
layer**, not synthesis or extraction — and addresses both corpora at once.

Practical reading:
- `answer_relevance ≈ 0.77` → the synthesizer is doing well
- `context_precision ≈ 0.27` → top-K is mostly noise (this is the gap)
- `faithfulness ≈ 0.39` → direct consequence of noisy context

The next-week investment is unambiguous: **better retrieval**. Query
rewriting (HyDE-style), larger candidate pool before rerank, semantic
chunking — anything that raises `context_precision` will raise
`faithfulness` automatically.

### Where the SEC pass rate sits — honest

The 56 % pass rate is concentrated in **one failure cluster**: 5 of 11 failures
are XLSX retrieval misses (q06, q07, q08, q19, q25). The XLSX summary
spreadsheet is competing against 10-K/10-Q financial table chunks for "revenue"
queries and loses on dense+sparse ranking — even though the spreadsheet
contains the precise per-quarter numbers the questions ask for.

This is exactly the failure mode FinanceBench documents at the corpus level:
vanilla RAG gets 19 % on SEC numeric QA, full-doc-in-context GPT-4 gets 78 %
(Patronus, 2023). The fix is intent-routed text-to-SQL over extracted tables,
not better retrieval; it's the **next** thing on the build list.

The remaining failures decompose to:
- 2 retrieval gaps (Apple climate, Apple tech risks) — addressable by Contextual Retrieval (Anthropic 2024)
- 2 judge-strict passes (cit_f1 correct but judge wants exact phrasing) — eval-side, not system
- 4 negative-case refusals (all PASS — system correctly refuses on Microsoft/Tesla/etc.)

### Per-domain tuning — the right answer

We measured the impact of MMR diversity reranking on both domains and found
they prefer **different** policies:

| Setting | SEC F1 | Legal F1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline (no MMR, no dedup, single-pass index) | 0.735 | 0.747 |
| Dedup on, MMR on (lambda=0.7)                 | 0.577 | **0.835** |
| Dedup on, MMR off (default)                   | 0.573 | n/a |

Two findings:

1. **Legal benefits clearly from MMR** (+0.09 F1). The 6 SPDX licenses share
   substantial near-duplicate boilerplate; diversity reranking surfaces a wider
   slice of distinct license terms.
2. **SEC regresses from dedup** (~−0.13 F1, irrespective of MMR). The XLSX
   cluster dominates; chunk-level dedup didn't help here because XLSX content
   was never being retrieved against the question in the first place.

`mmr_enabled: false` is the global default; `domains/legal/config.yaml` opts
in. This is the "layered config" pattern the PRD calls out, applied to
retrieval policy.

### What this proves and what it doesn't

**Proves:**
- The pluggability story is real — same code path, two unrelated domains, per-domain config wins/losses are measurable.
- Multi-source citation tracking works (Qdrant `also_in_files` populated for ~15 % of SEC chunks; live answers expose multiple source files per citation).
- Negative-case refusal is robust (4/4 on SEC, both negative cases on legal pass).

**Doesn't prove:**
- That every PRD-spec retrieval path is solved. The XLSX cluster (5 SEC failures) needs structured-query routing or Contextual Retrieval to recover.
- That the eval is reproducible to the third decimal — the LLM judge and the synthesizer both add ±5–10 % per-run variance (we observed 0.577 → 0.573 across two runs with the identical config + index).

Per-category breakdown (categories declared on each question via `tags`):

| Category | n | Pass | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `positive_lookup` | 11 | 9/11 | retrieval + cited synthesis |
| `positive_numeric` | 5 | 5/5 | XLSX row-level chunking + structured path |
| `cross_document` | 6 | 5/6 | multi-file reconciliation |
| `aggregate` | 3 | 2/3 | structured-query path against entities table |
| `negative_refusal` | 4 | **4/4** | Microsoft / Tesla / "first-ever filing year" all refused with citations to what *was* examined |
| `adversarial_paraphrase` | 3 | 2/3 | "Taiwanese fabricator" → resolves to TSMC |
| `adversarial_contradiction` | 1 | 1/1 | refuses to invent a year |

### Improvement vs baseline

|  | Baseline (16-Q) | Upgraded (25-Q, harder) |
| - | --- | --- |
| Citation F1 | 0.55 | **0.73** |
| Answer pass | 62.5 % | **76.0 %** |
| Negative-case correctness | 2/2 | **4/4** |

Failures decompose to:
- **q03 (NVDA TSMC)**: retrieval got half the right sources; the cross-encoder
  promoted them but the LLM didn't name TSMC in the cited form the judge wanted.
- **q09 (NVDA 10-Q operations)**: high retrieval, judge-strict on phrasing.
- **q14 (Apple tech risks)**: retrieval gap; the relevant 10-K section sits below
  rerank cutoff.
- **q17 (paraphrase: "Taiwanese fabricator")**: retrieval found the right files
  but LLM answered without the exact "TSMC" wording on this run.
- **q19 (Apple highest revenue)**: aggregate question; structured path didn't
  fire because intent classified it as `positive_numeric` not `aggregate`.
- **q21 (NVDA consistent themes)**: open-ended; judge wanted more than the answer
  produced even though the cited sources covered it.

## Pluggability (every dimension actually swappable)

| Dim | Default | Swap |

| Object store | MinIO (S3) | `KB_OBJECT_STORE=local` |

| Embeddings | BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (dense) + bm42 (sparse, optional) | `KB_EMBED_MODEL`, `KB_SPARSE_MODEL` |
| Reranker | Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 | `retrieve.rerank_with_cross_encoder: false` to disable |
| Source | `edgar`, `upload` | implement `Source` Protocol in `kb/sources/` |
| Schema / domain | SEC | drop a YAML in `domains/<name>/`, `kb schema apply` |

## What changed vs the baseline submission

1. **Intent extraction layer** — LLM parses the question for kind (lookup/aggregate/compare/negative) and facets (ticker, form_type, etc.); narrows downstream stages.
2. **Structured query path** — aggregation questions ("revenue > $60B?") run against the entities table directly, then cite the source files of matching mentions.
3. **Cross-encoder reranker** — ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 rescores top-30 candidates to top-10. The biggest single quality jump.
4. **Span-level citations** — per-citation excerpt narrowed to the most-relevant sentences inside the chunk via dense cosine, not the whole chunk text.
5. **Per-stage trace** — every `/query/trace/{id}` carries `_stages` with timing + per-stage details; `_token_usage` aggregates LLM cost.
6. **Trace visualization** — UI renders the stages as latency cards with intent + tokens metadata.
7. **pgvector filter whitelist** — defense in depth.
8. **Pre-warmed fastembed cache** in the Docker image (best-effort).
9. **Expanded eval** — 25 questions, including 4 negative-refusal and 3 adversarial paraphrase / 1 contradiction trap.
10. **Per-category eval scoring** — strengths/weaknesses surface per question type.

## Honest limits

- The intent stage is the biggest latency cost (~9s) because we run a tool-call LLM
  for every query. For latency-sensitive use this should be cached per-query-shape
  or replaced with a small classifier model.
- Sparse embedding bm42 occasionally fails to load on a cold image; system
  degrades to dense-only with a single warning and continues serving.
- Some intent classifications are conservative (`lookup` when `aggregate` would
  better serve the question), which suppresses the structured path.
- The `_intent` filters (ticker, form_type) currently feed soft boosting only;
  hardening them to payload filters needs `entity_type`/`ticker` indexed on the
  chunk payload at ingest time.
