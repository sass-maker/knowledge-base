# Knowledgebase Cloudflare Worker

Cloudflare-native Knowledgebase RAG Worker for fleet projects.

This Worker is the Cloudflare-native shared RAG surface owned by `knowledgebase`: Hono, free-ai/Workers AI embeddings, Vectorize search, D1 for chunk text and metadata, and optional R2 for raw document blobs.

For product integrations, use the dependency-free typed client in
`src/client.ts` (`KnowledgebaseClient`) instead of constructing ad hoc fetch
calls. `pnpm run audit:client-contract -- --require-complete` keeps the typed
custom-input, search, and query contract present.

## Frontend surfaces

This repo has two operator frontend surfaces:

| Surface | Path | Stack | Deploy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dashboard app** | `app/` | Vite + React (static) → Cloudflare Pages | `https://search.sassmaker.com` |
| **Operator testing UI** | Worker `/` and `/ui` | Inline HTML in Worker | `https://knowledgebase.sarthakagrawal927.workers.dev/ui` |

The dashboard app is the operator/admin UI for managing domains, ingesting
files, inspecting stored data, running queries, reviewing query history, and
viewing evals. Cloudflare Access authenticates the human; a same-origin Pages
Function validates that identity and adds the Worker service key server-side.
The Worker `/ui` remains as the low-level operator testing surface for direct
API control. See
[`docs/operations/dashboard-access.md`](../../docs/operations/dashboard-access.md).

## Cloudflare Resources

Create these before a real deploy:

```bash
wrangler vectorize create rag-gemini-1536 --dimensions=1536 --metric=cosine
wrangler vectorize create-metadata-index rag-gemini-1536 --propertyName=tenant --type=string
wrangler vectorize create-metadata-index rag-gemini-1536 --propertyName=index_id --type=string
wrangler d1 create rag-db
wrangler d1 migrations apply rag-db
wrangler r2 bucket create rag-raw-docs
wrangler secret put RAG_SERVICE_KEYS
# Optional, non-disruptive extra key map for temporary verification/cutover keys:
wrangler secret put RAG_SERVICE_KEYS_APPEND
# Optional, non-disruptive key map for the internal operator dashboard:
wrangler secret put RAG_SERVICE_DASHBOARD_KEYS
# Optional, non-disruptive key map for short-lived proof/eval runs:
wrangler secret put RAG_SERVICE_PROOF_KEYS
```

`RAG_ANALYTICS` is configured in `wrangler.jsonc`; Analytics Engine creates
the `knowledgebase_rag_events` dataset on first write.

`RAG_SERVICE_KEYS` is a JSON object mapping service keys to tenant names:

```json
{
  "replace-with-random-key": "saas-maker"
}
```

`RAG_SERVICE_KEYS_APPEND`, `RAG_SERVICE_DASHBOARD_KEYS`, and
`RAG_SERVICE_PROOF_KEYS` have the same shape and are merged after
`RAG_SERVICE_KEYS`. Use append for temporary cutover keys, dashboard keys for
the internal operator surface, and proof keys for short-lived verification/eval
runs without overwriting primary or consumer key maps.

Do not commit real keys.

Fleet-level verification lives in SaaS Maker:

```bash
cd ../../../saas-maker
pnpm fleet:secret-audit -- --project knowledgebase --fail-on-missing
```

After the secret is set, run the standalone deployed-readiness smoke:

```bash
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> pnpm run readiness:auth
```

Without a service key, `pnpm run readiness` still verifies that the deployed
health endpoint is live, D1 reports the required schema migrations through
`d1_schema: true`, Vectorize and R2 are bound, and protected `/v1/*` routes
reject anonymous access.
`pnpm run readiness:full-port` also checks deployed retired FastAPI aliases:
public `/healthz`/`/readyz`/`/metrics` must work and protected legacy aliases
such as `/search`, `/query`, and `/domains` must reject anonymous access. It
also verifies the deployed `/` and `/ui` hosted testing surface contains the
embedding-model selector and custom-input `/v1/kb/*` controls.
Run `pnpm run predeploy:local` before the real deploy. It runs Worker
tests/typecheck, binding and D1 migration preflight, Python runtime retirement audit, the
no-external-`rag-service` reference guard, the Linkchat/Starboard consumer
knowledgebase RAG integration audit, deployed public Karte demo chat and
Starboard app smoke, local Linkchat/Starboard Cloudflare bundle builds, the
local `../../../free-ai` embedding catalog and cost-audited
Cloudflare deploy-script audit, the upstream free-ai cost/type/test check, the
Vectorize embedding binding selectability audit, the
full-port gap matrix, the no-network NVDA scanned-PDF OCR eval payload dry-run,
the read-only embedding-model release plan, local cutover smoke, and Wrangler
deploy dry-run as a single gate. Run
`pnpm run deploy:dry-run` and
`pnpm run audit:python-runtime-retirement -- --require-complete` before the real
deploy. `pnpm run smoke:local-cutover` starts `wrangler dev --local` on an
ephemeral port and proves the same root aliases plus deploy fingerprint against
the locally bundled Worker. It only hits health/readiness/metrics and anonymous
auth-boundary routes; it does not run an embedding, OCR, or answer-generation
path. The local smoke sets `RAG_ALLOW_UNMIGRATED_LOCAL_D1=true` because
`wrangler dev --local` may start with an empty local D1; deployed readiness still
requires `d1_schema: true`. The selected embedding-model path is live in the
current release: deployed `free-ai` `/v1/models` returns enabled embedding rows
with dimensions, aliases, custom-dimension support, priority, and availability;
static fallback is not accepted as proof. The selected model must also report
`selectable: true` plus a compatible Vectorize binding from
`/v1/embedding-models`; otherwise the readiness gate and mutating CRUD smoke
fail before treating the model as deployable. Before future approved live
embedding/catalog actions, print the ordered checklist with `pnpm run
release-plan:embedding-model -- --json`; it is read-only, marks mutating steps,
and includes `cd ../../../free-ai && pnpm run check` before free-ai deploys so
the upstream cost audit/typecheck/tests are current. The JSON also prints
`configured_vectorize_metadata_index_commands` for the currently configured
Vectorize indexes. `RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> pnpm run
release-status:embedding-model -- --json --check-vectorize-metadata-indexes
--check-knowledgebase-embedding-models` is the full read-only live status gate
for the same release; with `RAG_SERVICE_KEY` it also proves deployed
`/v1/embedding-models` is backed by live free-ai rows whose selected model is
explicitly `selectable: true` with a compatible Vectorize binding, valid
provider, and positive numeric dimensions. It separately
checks configured Vectorize metadata indexes, the selected deployed model's
Vectorize binding/index detail, and every enabled embedding dimension advertised
by the deployed `free-ai` catalog; enabled free-ai embedding rows must include a
valid provider and positive numeric dimensions. The current deployed release is
green for every dimension advertised by deployed `free-ai`. The JSON report
includes `release_plan_steps` on each failed check, a de-duplicated
top-level `blocker_steps` list, and `blocker_commands` entries with command,
mutating, approval, optional, and required-env metadata so live blockers map
directly back to the ordered release plan. If the knowledgebase catalog check is
skipped because `RAG_SERVICE_KEY` is missing, it maps only to the read-only
`live-release-status` invocation step. When Vectorize metadata indexes are
missing, `blocker_commands` expands to the exact
`create-metadata-index` commands reported by the audit plus the follow-up
readiness audit. After future Vectorize provisioning/config updates, run
`pnpm run audit:vectorize-metadata-indexes -- --json --require-complete` to
verify each configured remote index has the `tenant` and `index_id` string
metadata indexes required by query filters. If it reports blockers, apply only
the `remediation_commands` from the audit output after explicit provisioning
approval, then rerun the audit with `--require-complete`; the release-plan
command candidates are for review, not a blanket instruction to create indexes
that already exist. After future D1 migrations and deploys, first run the
read-only catalog gate:

```bash
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> pnpm run readiness:embedding-model
```

Then run `RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> RAG_BASE_URL=<worker-url> pnpm run
smoke:rag-crud:embedding-model` to prove the live RAG create/ingest/query/delete
path, the `/v1/kb/ingest/text` custom-input domain path, `/v1/kb/search`, and
free-ai embedding-model selection. When the requested model is an alias, the
smoke expects both `POST /v1/indexes` and the temporary KB domain to persist the
canonical free-ai model id, provider, and dimensions from `/v1/embedding-models`.
The smoke first checks authenticated `/v1/healthz` and requires
`d1_schema: true`, Vectorize, R2 readiness, and the expected
`deploy_fingerprint` before creating the temporary index; it still mutates and
spends embedding calls after that gate, so it is intentionally not part of
`predeploy:local`. The release plan keeps consumer proof split into targeted
re-runs and live proof: local source audit (`audit:consumer-rag-integrations`),
public consumer smoke (`smoke:consumer-auth -- --json`), and local Cloudflare
consumer builds (`build:consumer-cloudflare`, which runs `../../../karte`
`cf:build` and `../../../starboard` `build:cf`) are already included in
`predeploy:local` and can be rerun directly after consumer-only changes;
approved consumer deploys (`../../../karte` and `../../../starboard`
`deploy:cf`) and authenticated account-flow smoke for karte profile memory plus
Starboard sync/search remain separate live steps that require
`KARTE_SESSION_COOKIE` and `STARBOARD_SESSION_COOKIE`. The local
consumer audit proves karte's profile-memory create/ingest/delete/search client
contract including document content/metadata and query/top_k payloads, plus
Starboard's user-scoped semantic search and ingest content/metadata contract,
rejects the old `src/lib/rag-service.ts` client filename in both consumers, and
verifies both checked-out consumer repos expose Cloudflare-backed `deploy:cf`
scripts that run the repo's Cloudflare build pipeline before deploy. The local
consumer builds prove those build pipelines bundle successfully; they still do
not deploy or prove live consumer bindings. Then run
full-port readiness after deploying the current
`cloudflare/worker` code; a 404 on these aliases means the deployed Worker is
behind local route parity.
For a focused alias check, run
`pnpm run smoke:legacy-routes -- --base-url <worker-url> --require-complete`.
The `/healthz` row should include
`deploy_fingerprint=knowledgebase-a-plus-evidence-2026-06-23` and
`d1_schema: true` after the current Cloudflare port and D1 migrations are
deployed. The smoke and full-port readiness gates
enforce that fingerprint by default; pass
`--expected-deploy-fingerprint <value>` only when intentionally deploying a
custom `RAG_DEPLOY_FINGERPRINT`.
The sibling `../rag-service` repo is already retired. Use
`pnpm run audit:sibling-rag-service -- --json --require-retired` to prove it
stays gone, and keep all fleet RAG runtime in this Worker package.
For a narrower read-only proof that fleet repos no longer actively point at the
old sibling service, run
`pnpm run audit:no-external-rag-service-references -- --json`. As of the
2026-06-21 retirement, `../rag-service` has been deleted and
`pnpm run audit:sibling-rag-service -- --json --require-retired` reports
`ok: true`, `retirement_ok: true`, and `sibling_exists: false`. This
guard scans fleet repos for old `rag-service` Worker bindings and URLs across
JSON/JSONC, JS/TS, TOML, YAML, and env-style `RAG_*` config references.
The sibling-retirement readiness gate also checks that the filesystem audit and
`../full-port-gaps.json` agree: the `sibling_rag_service_retirement` gap must
remain open while `../rag-service` exists, and must be closed after the folder is
removed.

Direct vector ingestion/query endpoints validate caller-supplied embeddings
against the index/profile dimensions before they reach Vectorize.

The retired FastAPI surface is preserved as Worker-side aliases that forward to
the Cloudflare-native handlers: `/search`, `/agent/search`, `/search/eval`,
`/query`, `/query/stream`, `/query/traces`, `/query/trace/:id`, `/projects`,
`/domains`, `/schemas`, `/files`, `/sources`, `/entities`, and `/ingest/*`.
`pnpm run audit:legacy-route-parity` is the Node-only release gate for this
inventory. `pnpm run preflight` runs it automatically and also fails if retired
Python runtime surfaces such as `src/kb`, `pyproject.toml`, or the root pytest
suite reappear.

The default deployed path chunks raw document text, embeds through `free-ai` with
`gemini-embedding-001` at 1536 dimensions, upserts vectors to the
`rag-gemini-1536` Vectorize index, stores hydrated chunk text in D1, and queries
Vectorize with server-enforced `tenant + index_id` metadata filters. Use
`GET /v1/embedding-models` to see the configured Vectorize dimension profiles
and the live free-ai embedding catalog when the `FREE_AI` binding or base URL is
reachable. `POST /v1/indexes` accepts `embedding_profile: "base" | "small"` or
an explicit `embedding_model` from free-ai when `RAG_EMBED_PROVIDER=free_ai`;
explicit model selection fails closed under Workers AI fallback. With
`RAG_EMBED_PROVIDER=free_ai`, default profile creation also validates that the
configured default model is present and enabled in the live free-ai catalog
before creating an index. `/v1/kb/domains` and first-touch custom input routes
accept an explicit `embedding_model` from the live free-ai catalog, persist the
canonical model/provider on the domain, and the hosted testing UI sends that
selected model with domain save, upload, infer-upload, schema inference, source
import, direct record/text ingest, and queued/inline domain ingest actions.
Auto-created `/v1/kb/*` domain indexes use the stored domain model when present,
otherwise the default base model, and persist the canonical model/provider. KB
staging and scheduling
entry points (`/v1/kb/files`, uploads, infer-upload, source import with
auto-ingest, schema/file reprocess, source-set requeue, async text, and queued
ingest) run the same readiness check before R2/D1 job mutation or
Queue/Workflow enqueue, so stale embedding config does not create doomed files,
jobs, or run messages. Inline record/text ingest also checks before staging raw
input, and existing stored KB index models are revalidated against the live
free-ai catalog before new work is scheduled. In the hosted testing UI, choosing an explicit model makes that model authoritative and omits
`embedding_profile`, so the model's dimensions choose the compatible Vectorize
binding. The Worker persists the selected embedding model/provider on the index
so later ingests and queries cannot drift if defaults change. A selected or default free-ai model must be
enabled in free-ai and its dimensions must match a configured Vectorize binding.
The hosted testing UI only lists explicit model choices when
`/v1/embedding-models` reports `catalog_source: "free_ai"` and model rows have
`selectable: true`; if the live
catalog is unavailable it falls back to profile defaults instead of offering
static model guesses. `VECTORIZE`
remains the default 1536-dim profile. `VECTORIZE_SMALL`, `VECTORIZE_1024`,
`VECTORIZE_768`, and `VECTORIZE_384` are configured in the current Cloudflare
release because deployed `free-ai` advertises enabled 384/768/1024/1536-dim
embedding rows. Models are listed in the testing UI only when their row is live,
enabled, and `selectable: true` with a compatible Vectorize binding. `pnpm run
audit:vectorize-embedding-bindings -- --json --require-all` reports all current
deployed free-ai dimensions configured. `pnpm run
audit:vectorize-metadata-indexes -- --json --require-complete` is the read-only
remote audit that confirms the required `tenant` and `index_id` metadata indexes
exist on every configured Vectorize index. The audit output includes
`remediation_commands` for missing metadata indexes on existing configured
indexes. The read-only
`release-plan:embedding-model -- --json` output mirrors the configured
metadata-index command candidates under
`configured_vectorize_metadata_index_commands` so approval can reference the
exact commands before provisioning.

The `/v1/kb/*` routes are the Cloudflare-native `knowledgebase` product state
surface. They use the D1 `kb_*` metadata tables for tenant-scoped domains,
R2-backed file upload/registration, corpus status, jobs, schemas, entities,
relationships, traces, and eval reports. The Worker now replaces the Python
runtime paths with TypeScript/Worker ingestion, parser, retrieval, and eval
tooling. The full Cloudflare port is live as of 2026-06-22: the current
embedding-model release is deployed, D1 migrations `0005_index_embedding_model.sql`
and `0006_kb_domain_embedding_model.sql` are applied, all deployed free-ai
embedding dimensions have Vectorize bindings plus metadata indexes,
`release-status:embedding-model`, `readiness:embedding-model`,
`smoke:rag-crud:embedding-model`, and `readiness:full-port` report green, live
scanned-PDF OCR parity is proven, sibling `../rag-service` retirement is proven,
and `pnpm run gaps:full-port` reports 0 remaining.

Consumer index policy:

- Karte/Linkchat uses one lazily-created profile-memory index per account
  (`users.smIndexId`, index name `linkchat-${userId}`) and scopes profile memory
  documents with `userId`, `pageId`, `pageSlug`, and `blockId` metadata. The
  `/api/settings/knowledgebase` route exposes account index status and repair.
- Starboard uses one shared application index from `STARBOARD_RAG_INDEX_ID` and
  scopes every query and ingest with `user_id` metadata because each account's
  corpus is small and relevance needs to cross that account's saved repos.
- Prefer account indexes when a product has user-owned mutable memory that needs
  cheap deletes and no cross-account fanout. Prefer a shared app index plus
  metadata filters when each account's slice is small and the product benefits
  from fewer Vectorize indexes. Split further by domain/page only after measured
  p95 latency, file count, or delete/rebuild volume shows the account index is
  too large.
- Do not rely on caller-supplied tenant/index filters for isolation. The Worker
  always enforces service-key tenant and `index_id` server-side before Vectorize.

Schema inference accepts structured records, JSON/NDJSON/CSV-like input, HTML,
digital PDF text with coordinate-derived table rows, XLSX rows, DOCX paragraph text, PPTX slide text, or
text samples and produces a reviewable schema draft. It also declares inferred
parent/ref relationships from fields such as `parent_id`, `owner_id`, and
`related_ids`, plus prefixed cross-type entities such as
`customer_id/customer_name`; ingest persists those edges in D1 and can resolve
targets already present from earlier ingests by exact identity or canonicalized
identity/display-name aliases. `/v1/kb/relationships/backfill`
rebuilds graph edges for historical D1 entities from active schemas. Search evals score the live Worker retrieval path
with hit rate, MRR, and latency summaries. `/v1/kb/ingest/run` queues staged R2
files for a domain through `KbIngestWorkflow` plus the bound Cloudflare Queue by
default, then parses those Worker-native formats, indexes them into the domain
Vectorize index, and marks the D1 file state ready/failed. Direct Queue dispatch
remains the fallback if the Workflow binding is absent. Send `async: false` only
for explicit inline debug runs. Queued and inline ingestion carry durable
`run_id` values; use `/v1/kb/ingest/runs/:run_id` or the hosted UI's run
progress control to watch Workflow status, job status, stages, and completion.
`/v1/kb/ingest/record` writes virtual JSON records to R2, indexes them, and
persists D1 structured entities immediately. When the domain has no active
schema, it infers and activates one from the posted records; when a schema
already exists, it still validates the requested type against that schema.
`/v1/kb/ingest/text` writes virtual text files to R2 and indexes them inline by
default, without requiring an active schema; pass `async: true` to stage the
normal parser job instead.
`/v1/kb/sources/import` supports
`source: "url"` and `source: "edgar"`; EDGAR config accepts `tickers`, `ciks`,
`forms`, `days`, `per_ticker_per_form`, `limit_total`, and `user_agent`.
Set `RAG_SEC_USER_AGENT` or pass `config.user_agent` so SEC requests are
identified. The hosted UI exposes URL and EDGAR source import controls alongside
source-set management, schema inference, direct structured-record/domain-text
input controls, and ingest run controls.
`/readyz` and `/metrics` preserve the retired FastAPI meta surface with
Cloudflare-native dependency checks and Prometheus-compatible text output.
`/v1/kb/search` queries that domain without exposing low-level index IDs.
`/v1/kb/query/stream` preserves the retired FastAPI SSE contract for clients
that want immediate first-byte feedback: it emits `started`, replayed `stage`,
and final `answer` or `error` events over `text/event-stream` while reusing the
same Worker answer path as `/v1/kb/query`.
Digital PDF ingestion includes a dependency-free layout pass that preserves
coordinate-derived row text and emits markdown table documents for table-like
pages. `RAG_MARKDOWN_CONVERSION=auto` falls back to Workers AI Markdown
Conversion for scanned PDFs, images, legacy Excel, ODF/ODT, Apple Numbers, and
weak local parses; use `always` to force conversion for complex PDFs or `off`
to disable it. `RAG_VISION_OCR_MODEL` can opt in direct Workers AI image OCR for
standalone JPEG/PNG/WebP uploads and image-only PDFs; the Worker sends upload
image bytes or embedded PDF JPEG/JPX images directly and converts basic Flate
RGB/grayscale PDF image streams to PNG for vision models. Use a comma-separated
model chain to try one Cloudflare vision model before the next. PDF vision OCR
filters/prioritizes page-like images before calling Workers AI so tiny embedded
logos and decorative assets do not consume the first OCR calls when a scanned
page image is present.
Upload schema inference, `/v1/kb/ingest/run`, and parse eval payloads can set
`markdown_conversion` and `vision_ocr_model` per request to test a model chain
without changing Worker secrets; queued and Workflow-backed ingestion preserve
those parser options in the run payload. Parse evals retry later models when the
first model returns text but still misses required `expected_text` snippets.
When explicit vision OCR and Markdown Conversion both return text, the parser stores a merged
`workers-ai-vision-markdown-ocr-v1` artifact instead of discarding one output.
Vision OCR is intentionally unset by default until an accepted model proves both
accurate and fast enough. `POST /v1/kb/evals/parse` runs parser-quality eval
cases over inline `content` or `content_base64` fixture bytes, persists D1
reports with `kind: "parse"`, and is available from the hosted testing UI.
`scripts/legacy-parse-eval.mjs` builds those evals from the
migrated legacy D1 export and mirrored raw/parse object roots. Earlier deployed
evidence was 18/19 migrated legacy parser cases passing, with exact scanned-PDF
OCR as the one miss. That gap is now closed: the deployed live OCR gate
(`readiness:full-port` `nvda-scanned-ocr-live`, `RAG_ALLOW_LIVE_OCR=1`) passed
with pass_rate 1 on the Cloudflare vision model chain. Pass
`--vision-ocr-model @cf/meta/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct,@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
to `scripts/legacy-parse-eval.mjs` with
`--filename-contains NVDA_riskfactors_sample_scanned.pdf` to re-test only that
scanned fixture through the merged vision/Markdown path. If no D1 export is
available, the same script can build a one-file case from the local MinIO mirror
with `--direct-domain sec --direct-content-hash <hash> --direct-filename
NVDA_riskfactors_sample_scanned.pdf`; it can read MinIO inline `xl.meta` objects
for this targeted parity proof. Use `--require-cases --min-pass-rate 1` for the
final live parity gate so the command fails on a missing case or any OCR miss.
`pnpm run eval:parse:nvda-scanned:dry-run` verifies the local one-case payload
without network or AI usage and prints the selected vision OCR model chain, base
URL, and pass-rate gate. After `RAG_SERVICE_KEY` is available,
`pnpm run eval:parse:nvda-scanned:live` runs the same one-case fail-closed gate
against the deployed Worker. Use `pnpm run readiness:full-port` as the final
release gate after `pnpm run deploy:dry-run` passes, the current Worker code is
deployed, the live OCR eval is explicitly allowed, and sibling retirement
remains complete; it combines deployed health/auth checks, deployed legacy-alias
smoke checks, the deployed hosted testing UI check, the deploy fingerprint check,
the live OCR eval, `pnpm run preflight`, the Python runtime retirement audit,
the sibling `rag-service` retirement audit, and the Worker-local Node full-port
gap gate.
In full-port mode the live OCR eval is cost-guarded: it is skipped until the
deployed root aliases and `deploy_fingerprint` prove the current Worker build,
and still requires `RAG_ALLOW_LIVE_OCR=1` or `--allow-live-ocr` before spending
Workers AI OCR.
`readiness:sibling-retirement` was used between the post-deploy/live-OCR proof
and the actual sibling-folder deletion. After retirement, use
`pnpm run audit:sibling-rag-service -- --json` plus
`pnpm run gaps:full-port -- --json` to prove the sibling remains gone and the
gap matrix stays complete.
`pnpm run gaps:full-port` prints the same Worker-local gap gate without needing
the Python toolchain; the matrix is shared with the root CLI through
`../full-port-gaps.json`.
Explicit `hybrid` query mode fuses BM25-style fuzzy D1 sparse lexical and Vectorize evidence with RRF
and local keyword rerank/MMR. Set `rerank_model: "workers_ai"` to run the
Cloudflare `@cf/baai/bge-reranker-base` neural reranker over the bounded
candidate set before returning results. Lexical timing reports
`lexical_scoring: "bm25_fuzzy_sparse_v3"` and `lexical_prefilter:
"chunk_cache_full_scan"` when that zero-AI sparse scorer is used; hot
lexical/hybrid queries reuse the in-Worker chunk cache instead of issuing D1
LIKE prefilter scans. The chunk cache stores a prepared sparse-token corpus, so
non-query-cache lexical misses do not re-tokenize every cached chunk.
`semantic` mode first checks for strong sparse evidence (`retrieval:
"semantic_lexical_fast_path"`) and returns that zero-AI result before embedding
or Vectorize when the lexical score and overlap are high enough. Weak sparse
matches still fall through to semantic Vectorize plus the existing corrective
hybrid fallback.
The deployed Worker enables Cloudflare-native hot-path persistence with
`RAG_SHARED_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED=true` and
`RAG_SHARED_EMBEDDING_CACHE_ENABLED=true`: exact query payloads and normalized
query embeddings are reused through D1 across Worker isolates before the route
falls back to external embedding generation or Vectorize. Migration
`0007_embedding_cache.sql` creates the embedding cache table; query payload
cache storage remains in `0002_query_cache.sql`.
Successful query traces persist timing stage breakdowns and empty-result
diagnostic fields in `confidence.timing_stages` and
`confidence.empty_result_diagnostics`; operator reports use those fields for
observability grading.
`/v1/kb/query` defaults to the fast
extractive cited answer path; set `answer_mode: "workers_ai"` to synthesize a
richer cited answer with Workers AI using `answer_model`, `RAG_ANSWER_MODEL`, or
`@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`, with deterministic extractive fallback when the
model returns no usable citations. Lexical paths apply deterministic rewrite and
decompose fanout for multi-part questions, with `query_rewrite: false` and
`query_decompose: false` available for benchmark comparisons. Explicit
`semantic` mode corrects low-score or empty Vectorize evidence with cached D1
lexical fallback before returning, without making a second Workers AI embedding
call.
`/v1/kb/query` responses include deterministic answer/evidence verification in
`confidence` and persist the same verification fields into D1 query traces.
`/v1/kb/evals/query` keeps deterministic scoring as the default and accepts
`ai_judge: true` with an optional `judge_model` to add Workers AI model-judged
AIS-style support scores to rows, summaries, and D1 reports.
Successful query traces and eval reports also emit compact data points to the
`RAG_ANALYTICS` Analytics Engine dataset when bound.
Source-set management is domain-backed: `/v1/kb/source-sets` summarizes files,
statuses, bytes, and MIME groups; `/v1/kb/source-sets/domain:<domain>/actions`
supports dry-run requeue/archive/delete actions with Vectorize/R2/D1 cleanup for
deletes, including the core RAG chunks used by lexical search.

## Backfill Existing SaaS Maker Chunks

The import script accepts a JSON export of existing saas-maker chunks with precomputed embeddings. It calls `POST /v1/indexes/:id/ingest-vectors`, so no Workers AI re-embedding is needed during migration.

```bash
RAG_BASE_URL=https://knowledgebase.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev \
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
node scripts/backfill-saas-maker.mjs \
  --input saas-maker-chunks.json \
  --index-name "SaaS Maker Knowledge" \
  --external-id <saas-maker-index-id>
```

Dry-run a fixture locally:

```bash
pnpm run backfill:dry-run
```

## Migrate Raw Files Into R2/D1

Use `scripts/migrate-raw-files.mjs` when existing local or MinIO-exported raw
files need to become Cloudflare-owned R2/D1 state. Directory mode applies one
domain to all discovered files; manifest mode can assign per-file domains and
filenames; object-root mode reads exports shaped like
`<domain>/<content_hash>/<filename>`. Dry-runs emit per-file SHA-256 plans; live
uploads fail if the Worker returns a different content hash.

```bash
RAG_BASE_URL=https://knowledgebase.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev \
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
node scripts/migrate-raw-files.mjs \
  --manifest raw-migration.json \
  --infer-schema \
  --apply-schema \
  --queue-ingest
```

Dry-run the sample manifest locally:

```bash
pnpm run migrate:raw:dry-run
pnpm run migrate:raw:objects:dry-run
```

For a legacy MinIO export, mirror the raw object prefix into a plain directory
outside this repo first, then run object-root mode:

```bash
# Do not point --object-root at data/minio/kb-bucket/raw directly. That is
# MinIO's disk/erasure layout; it contains xl.meta files and will be rejected.

RAG_BASE_URL=https://knowledgebase.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev \
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
node scripts/migrate-raw-files.mjs \
  --object-root exports/raw \
  --infer-schema \
  --apply-schema \
  --queue-ingest
```

## Migrate Legacy Metadata To D1

Export the legacy Postgres product-state tables as JSON, then generate D1 SQL:

```bash
pnpm run migrate:d1:export-sql > legacy-kb-export.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -At -f legacy-kb-export.sql > legacy-kb-export.json

node scripts/migrate-d1-metadata.mjs \
  --input legacy-kb-export.json \
  --out d1-metadata.sql
```

Dry-run the checked-in fixture first:

```bash
pnpm run migrate:d1:dry-run
```

The generated SQL targets the `kb_*` D1 tables, inserts rows in foreign-key
order, dedupes by each D1 conflict key, and reports a normalized SHA-256
checksum for count/checksum comparison before applying:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute rag-db --remote --file d1-metadata.sql
```

## Smoke A SaaS Maker Export

After exporting an index from SaaS Maker with
`GET /v1/knowledge/indexes/:id/export`, smoke the exact pre-embedded migration
path through `knowledgebase`:

```bash
RAG_BASE_URL=https://knowledgebase.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev \
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
node scripts/smoke-saas-maker-export.mjs \
  --input saas-maker-knowledge-export.json \
  --limit 10
```

The smoke creates a temporary RAG index, imports the exported vectors, waits and
polls until Vectorize makes them queryable, queries by vector, reports latency and
hit rate, and deletes the temporary index unless `--keep-index` is passed.

The same exported-vector smoke can be run through the readiness wrapper:

```bash
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
node scripts/deploy-readiness.mjs \
  --require-auth \
  --export-input saas-maker-knowledge-export.json
```

## Benchmark Latency And Hit Rate

The benchmark harness can hit local `wrangler dev` or a deployed Worker. It can create
a temporary index from raw documents, run repeated text queries, and report latency
percentiles, cache hits, and simple expected-result hit rate.

```bash
RAG_BASE_URL=https://knowledgebase.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev \
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
node scripts/benchmark-rag.mjs \
  --input fixtures/benchmark.sample.json \
  --repeat 5 \
  --top-k 5
```

Use `--index-id <id>` to benchmark an existing populated index. Add `--cleanup` only
when the script created the benchmark index and you want it deleted after the run.
Fresh-index runs wait 15 seconds after ingest by default so Vectorize can make
newly-upserted vectors queryable before accuracy is scored.
Use `--warmup <n>` to run unmeasured passes before collecting latency samples.
Use `--cache-mode bypass-read-write` when you need non-cache latency evidence:
the benchmark skips query/answer result cache reads and avoids writing synthetic
benchmark payloads back into the shared query cache. Embedding cache still stays
available, so repeated semantic proof runs do not spend extra embedding calls
just to prove retrieval-path cache misses.

## Operator Performance Report

Use the read-only operator report to inspect existing projects, domains, indexes,
files, jobs, source sets, recent traces, eval summaries, selectable embedding
models, hosted UI capability evidence, and cost-risk signals from one command:

```bash
RAG_BASE_URL=https://knowledgebase.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev \
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
pnpm run operator:report -- --domain <domain>
```

Add an existing index benchmark when you want speed numbers without ingesting new
data:

```bash
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
pnpm run operator:report -- \
  --index-id <index-id> \
  --query "what should this account remember?" \
  --mode semantic \
  --repeat 5 \
  --top-k 5
```

The default report performs only GET requests after health/auth-boundary checks.
The benchmark option calls `/v1/indexes/:id/benchmark-query` on an existing
index; it does not create, ingest, or delete data.

## A/A+ Scorecard

Use the proof runner to generate readiness, deterministic query eval, operator,
benchmark, and scorecard artifacts for one deployed domain. It is intentionally
evidence-gated: missing benchmarks, eval reports, traces, deploy readiness, or
ingestion status lower the grade instead of letting the service claim A/A+ by
assumption.

```bash
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
pnpm run proof:a-plus -- \
  --domain <domain> \
  --output-dir /tmp/kb-a-plus-proof
```

The command first runs deployed readiness and stops before eval/benchmark
requests if the Worker fingerprint or health checks are stale. After readiness
passes, it writes local JSON proof artifacts and creates deterministic query
eval/query trace evidence on the deployed Worker, then runs authenticated
inventory, lexical `kb-search`, semantic `kb-query`, and the A/A+ scorecard.
`pnpm run proof:s` uses the S-grade consumer fixture, seeds it through
`/v1/kb/ingest/text`, and repeats deterministic query evals to produce enough
cached trace/eval evidence for observability grading; repeated eval artifacts
are written to `query-evals.json`. S proof benchmarks run with one warmup pass
and `cache_mode: "bypass_read_write"` so the retrieval-performance gate has
measured non-cache samples for lexical `kb-search` and semantic `kb-query`
without globally disabling production caches. Retrieval-performance S uses
server-owned timing for the hard gate and reports client-observed p95
separately, so local network RTT spikes do not downgrade a Worker path whose
server-side non-cache timing is still S. The S proof also records public
consumer smoke evidence for Karte's demo chat endpoint and Starboard's public
app. Cookie-backed Karte profile-memory mutation and Starboard sync/search
smokes remain separate authenticated account-flow evidence; missing
`KARTE_SESSION_COOKIE` or `STARBOARD_SESSION_COOKIE` is reported as skipped
instead of capping the public consumer reliability grade.
The benchmark input must include at least two labeled queries with
`expected_contains`, `expected_document_ids`, or `expected_chunk_ids`; invalid
proof inputs fail locally before readiness or live requests. Use `--dry-run` to
inspect the planned proof without network calls or file writes:

```bash
pnpm run proof:a-plus -- --domain <domain> --dry-run
```

Pass `--continue-after-readiness-failure` only when intentionally collecting
diagnostics from a stale or partially failing deployment.

For debugging individual artifacts, run the lower-level commands directly:

```bash
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
pnpm run operator:report -- \
  --json \
  --domain <domain> \
  --index-id <index-id> \
  --query "what should this account remember?" \
  > /tmp/kb-operator-report.json

RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> \
node scripts/deploy-readiness.mjs --json \
  > /tmp/kb-readiness.json

Save a deterministic `/v1/kb/evals/query` response for the same domain to
`/tmp/kb-query-eval.json`, or use `pnpm run proof:a-plus` to generate it
automatically.

pnpm run scorecard:a-plus -- \
  --input /tmp/kb-operator-report.json \
  --readiness-report /tmp/kb-readiness.json \
  --query-eval-report /tmp/kb-query-eval.json \
  --require-readiness-report \
  --require-grade A
```

For A+ performance evidence, run route-specific benchmarks and pass them
directly to the scorecard. The operator report already includes capability proof
for the hosted UI, custom text input, async progress, and whether visible UI copy
hides retrieval/storage internals. Existing domain/index benchmarks can use a
query-only input file; `documents` are required only when the benchmark creates a
temporary index:

```bash
RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> pnpm run benchmark:rag -- \
  --input fixtures/benchmark.sample.json \
  --surface kb-search \
  --domain <domain> \
  --mode lexical \
  --warmup 1 \
  --cache-mode bypass-read-write \
  --repeat 5 \
  > /tmp/kb-benchmark-lexical.json

RAG_SERVICE_KEY=<service-key> pnpm run benchmark:rag -- \
  --input fixtures/benchmark.sample.json \
  --surface kb-query \
  --domain <domain> \
  --mode semantic \
  --warmup 1 \
  --cache-mode bypass-read-write \
  --repeat 5 \
  > /tmp/kb-benchmark-semantic.json

pnpm run scorecard:a-plus -- \
  --operator-report /tmp/kb-operator-report.json \
  --readiness-report /tmp/kb-readiness.json \
  --query-eval-report /tmp/kb-query-eval.json \
  --require-readiness-report \
  --benchmark /tmp/kb-benchmark-lexical.json \
  --benchmark /tmp/kb-benchmark-semantic.json \
  --expected-deploy-fingerprint knowledgebase-a-plus-evidence-2026-06-23 \
  --require-domain <domain> \
  --require-benchmark-mode lexical \
  --require-benchmark-mode semantic \
  --require-benchmark-surface kb-search \
  --require-benchmark-surface kb-query \
  --min-benchmark-repeat 5 \
  --min-benchmark-samples 10 \
  --min-query-eval-rows 2 \
  --require-eval-kind query \
  --require-grade A+
```

The initial thresholds are:

- lexical A+: p95 <= 300 ms; A: p95 <= 500 ms
- hybrid A+: p95 <= 1000 ms; A: p95 <= 1500 ms
- semantic A+: p95 <= 2000 ms; A: p95 <= 3000 ms
- A+ proof command: each benchmark report must have repeat >= 5 and at least 10
  measured requests
- direct query eval evidence must include at least 2 evaluated rows for A+
- retrieval quality A+: hit rate >= 0.92 plus citation/eval evidence and any
  required eval report kinds; A: hit rate >= 0.85 plus citation/eval evidence
  and any required eval report kinds
