## Why / What

Ship and operate **Private Agent Search** as the fleet `RAG_SERVICE` on
Cloudflare. Keep `knowledgebase` the only fleet RAG codebase; keep the
Cloudflare Worker (`cloudflare/worker`) the only runtime; keep cited evidence
the non-negotiable product invariant.

## Dependencies

- Cloudflare Workers, Pages, D1, Vectorize, R2, Access, and the Fleet `free-ai`
  gateway.
- Fleet consumers currently include Karte, Research Papers, and Starboard.

## Timeline

- **2026-10-07** — Deployed a separate Modal embedding experiment with
  EmbeddingGemma 2's text encoder and a BGE-small comparison endpoint. Exact
  source-digest SDK/ASGI inference checks passed with real weights; both HTTP
  endpoints reject unauthenticated requests. This experiment is outside the RAG
  runtime and is not integrated with stored indexes. The Free AI gateway rollout
  is tracked in [Free AI #100](https://github.com/sass-maker/free-ai/issues/100).
  See the [trial runbook](docs/operations/embedding-model-trial.md)
  and [issue #64](https://github.com/sass-maker/knowledge-base/issues/64).

- **2026-10-02** — Prepared the Free AI Issue [#83](https://github.com/sass-maker/free-ai/issues/83)
  consumer integration in a clean branch: default BGE base inference and
  managed synthesis use the private FleetGateway binding; stored BGE mean/768
  coordinates and existing query/storage admission remain unchanged. The
  unpriced neural reranker is denied before inference and uses the existing
  keyword fallback. Source work is not merged or deployed; no vectors were
  rewritten.

- **2026-09-08** — Added an offline read-only legacy ownership inventory over
  an explicit SQLite snapshot, plus verified offline raw-copy staging that
  preserves source bytes and emits separate owned-key artifacts and a manifest.
  The inventory identifies shared references, proposed owned
  keys and unresolved writers without copying or publishing records. Local
  migrated-SQLite and CLI tests cover tenant boundaries and unchanged input.
  This is preparation for issue 48; backfill, activation and live qualification
  remain incomplete.

- **2026-08-31** — Added source-ready product-owned Microsoft Clarity tracking
  to the public landing and disclosed both public analytics services in its
  HTML and Markdown product brief. The Access-protected operator workspace is
  deliberately outside this landing layout. No deployment ran.
- **2026-07-31** — Recovered an independently buildable public landing source
  under `landing-astro/`, separate from the Access-protected dashboard and RAG
  Worker. One typed public-route registry now drives the HTML landing,
  substantive Markdown, `/api/ai`, `llms.txt`, robots, and an HTML-only
  sitemap. The local production build passes the Fleet agent-readiness audit
  at S-tier with 100% route Markdown coverage and 100% catalog integrity.
  Production Pages configuration and deployment are unchanged.
- **2026-07-31** — Replaced route-presence inference in the S-grade ingestion
  score with exercised idempotent replay, chunk-preview/reprocess, and
  classified-failure evidence. Added a typed `/v1/kb/query` HTTP compatibility
  test plus current OpenAI Agents SDK and LangChain.js integration examples.
- **2026-07-31** — Corrected public discovery and search/social metadata to the
  canonical `knowledgebase.sassmaker.com` host, added an owned preview image,
  and locally verified the app build; production deployment remains separate.
- **2026-07-30** — Added a product-owned changelog to the operator dashboard
  with verified release history and canonical Roadmap and Source links.

Historical milestones live in
[`docs/knowledge/archive/project-status-2026-06-28.md`](docs/knowledge/archive/project-status-2026-06-28.md).

## Products

- Worker RAG API and operator `/ui`.
- Public product landing source in `landing-astro/`, intended for the existing
  `knowledgebase-landing` Pages project; source recovery is complete but the
  production project has not been changed or redeployed.
- Access-protected dashboard at `https://search.sassmaker.com`.
- Product-owned release history at `https://search.sassmaker.com/changelog`.

## Features (shipped)

- **Embedding experiment:** independent CPU-only Modal endpoints for
  EmbeddingGemma 2 text/code and BGE-small English embeddings, with built-in
  proxy authentication, bounded input, and scale-to-zero after 30 idle seconds.
  Usage and verification boundaries are in the
  [trial runbook](docs/operations/embedding-model-trial.md).
- **Public discovery source:** the independently built landing keeps public
  product truth separate from authenticated operator and retrieval surfaces.
  Its one route has a substantive Markdown counterpart plus shared
  `/api/ai`, `llms.txt`, robots, and sitemap coverage; local boundary checks
  reject Worker endpoints and credential-shaped output.
- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Worker is the only RAG runtime. Python FastAPI
  service, Python UI, Docker Compose, and the sibling `../rag-service` repo
  are retired. `audit:sibling-rag-service --require-retired` stays green.
- **Embedding-model/catalog release:** live. `free-ai` gateway returns 6
  enabled embedding models; all advertised dimensions (384/768/1024/1536) have
  Vectorize bindings + `tenant`/`index_id` metadata indexes; D1 migrations
  `0005`/`0006`/`0007` applied; `release-status:embedding-model`,
  `readiness:embedding-model`, `smoke:rag-crud:embedding-model`, and
  `readiness:full-port` (with `RAG_ALLOW_LIVE_OCR=1`) report `ok: true`.
- **Performance cache release:** live. `RAG_SHARED_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED=true`,
  `RAG_SHARED_EMBEDDING_CACHE_ENABLED=true`; semantic queries use a strong
  lexical precheck before embedding/Vectorize.
- **A+ evidence release:** deployed. Live Starboard-domain proof passed
  overall A+ (readiness, scoped query eval, lexical `kb-search`, semantic
  `kb-query`, ingestion, observability, hosted UI). Final benchmark p95s:
  lexical 99.46 ms, semantic 550.73 ms; query eval hit/citation rates 1.0.
- **Frontend surfaces:** Vite + React dashboard deployed on Cloudflare Pages at
  `search.sassmaker.com`; Worker `/ui` operator testing surface. The former
  OpenNext Worker remains available on its `workers.dev` hostname as a rollback
  target, but no longer owns the production custom domain. Home, operator
  configuration, navigation, and direct `/domains` deep-link smoke passed after
  the 2026-07-25 cutover. The internal dashboard is now protected by Cloudflare
  Access with a single-email allow policy on the custom, Pages, and preview
  hostnames; its server-side proxy uses a dedicated tenant-scoped Worker
  credential. Live Data, Query History, and cited-query verification passed.
- **Deployed corpus is live.** The `legal` and `sec` domains contain queryable
  files, entities, relationships, and recorded traces, but they are evaluation
  fixtures rather than SaaS Maker project data.
- **SaaS Maker project operator view:** live. The Access-protected dashboard
  discovers project scopes through a dashboard-only Worker route, selects
  Research Papers by default, switches independently to Starboard, and hides
  demo/test/proof scopes unless the operator enables them. Deployed from
  `777c39e`: Worker version `ec4b9572-9942-4009-9716-3d723106acca`; Pages
  deployment `07c5c2b9-7c37-4e08-8213-4efbacd708ab`.
- **Consumer boundary:** Karte remains an active Knowledgebase consumer for
  indexed profile memory. High Signal integration is cancelled: its current
  public-evidence workflow already has product-owned Git + D1 retrieval and
  does not need private-corpus search.
- **Owned release history:** the dashboard includes a same-origin `/changelog`
  with verified editorial milestones. Planned work remains in GitHub Issues;
  Source points to the canonical organization repository.
- **Agent integration contract:** the dependency-free `KnowledgebaseClient`
  has an executable `/v1/kb/query` request/citation compatibility test, with
  framework adapters documented for OpenAI Agents SDK and LangChain.js.
- **Ingest safety proof:** S-grade proof replays a seeded document and submits
  a controlled invalid payload, so idempotency, preview/reprocess, and failure
  classification capabilities come from exercised responses rather than route
  availability.

### Deploy fingerprint

The deployed Worker advertises
`knowledgebase-a-plus-evidence-2026-06-23`. `smoke:legacy-routes` and
`readiness:full-port` enforce the fingerprint by default; pass
`--expected-deploy-fingerprint <value>` only when intentionally deploying a
custom `RAG_DEPLOY_FINGERPRINT`. When the fingerprint changes, update this
line and move the old snapshot into the archive.

## Work queue

Open work is tracked only in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sass-maker/knowledge-base/issues).
An open issue is a to-do, a linked pull request is in progress, and merge plus
issue closure makes the work done.


## 2026-09-09 — offline parse provenance source candidate

Issue 48 gains a provider-free parse staging command over verified raw exports
and a read-only SQLite snapshot. Existing local format parsers are reused;
offline-only PDF.js provides page-tree ordered text and page/excerpt provenance.
Artifacts are deterministic per owner/file, retries verify immutable bytes, and
unsupported/OCR/password cases remain blocked. The hosted Worker parser is
unchanged. This is preparation only: every manifest keeps publication false;
ledger reservation, indexed/structured backfill, unsettled-write recovery,
production migration/activation and owner-account acceptance remain unqualified.
See the [canonical workflow receipt](docs/development/document-workflow-qualification-2026-09-07.md#offline-parse-provenance-reconstruction-2026-09-09-source-candidate).


The separate dependency follow-up restores the full local quality gate without
expanding advisory exceptions. Existing build/development dependencies were
patched and landing desktop/mobile text, links and layout retained. This does
not change issue 48's production/backfill/owner-account gates. See the
[dependency validation receipt](docs/development/document-workflow-qualification-2026-09-07.md#dependency-gate-follow-up-2026-09-09).


## 2026-09-09 — never-dispatched recovery source candidate

The owned-file ledger can safely cancel an operation only while every artifact
write remains prepared (or no intent exists). Every supported owned producer
must durably win dispatch first. Cancellation and dispatch serialize through
D1/SQLite; unknown legacy or started/accepted/confirmed writes remain pending.
This requires additive source migration 0010, tested only on synthetic SQLite.
An authenticated tenant-scoped recovery route remains behind the existing
internal ownership activation gate. No automatic recovery, migration deployment
or production activation is included. See the [recovery contract](docs/development/document-workflow-qualification-2026-09-07.md#never-dispatched-operation-recovery-2026-09-09-source-candidate).

## 2026-09-10 — settled prepared-artifact cleanup

Cleanup now completes a never-dispatched artifact intent once its producer has
settled, instead of waiting for a vector that was never written to appear.
Started and uncertain writes still require provider convergence. The regression
uses the real SQLite ledger and covers all three dispatch states. This source
fix retains issue 48's migration, activation and authenticated acceptance gates.
